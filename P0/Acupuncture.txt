AcupunctureAcupuncture is a form of alternative medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body  It is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine  TCM   TCM theory and practice are not based upon scientific knowledge  and acupuncture is a pseudoscience  There are a diverse range of acupuncture theories based on different philosophies  and techniques vary depending on the country  The method used in TCM is likely the most widespread in the US  It is most often used for pain relief  though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions  Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment  The conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent  An overview of Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions  and it suggests acupuncture may be effective only for chemotherapy induced nausea vomiting  postoperative nausea vomiting  and idiopathic headache  A systematic review of systematic reviews found little evidence of acupuncture s effectiveness in treating pain  The evidence suggests that short term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long term benefits  Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain  though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture s effects are mainly due to placebo  A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias  A meta analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost effective as an adjunct to standard care  while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain  Acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single use needles  When properly delivered  it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects  Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect of the practitioner  A review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade  The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections  Since serious adverse events continue to be reported  it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk  Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as qi  meridians  and acupuncture points  and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy  qi  flowing through meridians  which was a major part of early belief systems  Acupuncture is believed to have originated around     BC in China  around the time The Yellow Emperor s Classic of Internal Medicine  Huangdi Neijing  was published  though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier  Over time  conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar  celestial and earthly cycles  yin and yang energies  and a body s  rhythm  on the effectiveness of treatment  Acupuncture grew and diminished in popularity in China repeatedly  depending on the country s political leadership and the favor of rationalism or Western medicine  Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the  th century AD  then to Japan through medical missionaries  and then to Europe  starting with France  In the   th century  as it spread to the United States and Western countries  the spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflict with Western beliefs were abandoned in favor of tapping needles into nerves       Clinical practice     Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine  It is commonly used for pain relief  though it is also used to treat a wide range of conditions  The majority of people who seek out acupuncture do so for musculoskeletal problems  including low back pain  shoulder stiffness  and knee pain  Acupuncture is generally only used in combination with other forms of treatment  For example  American Society of Anesthesiologists states it may be considered in the treatment for nonspecific  noninflammatory low back pain only in conjunction with conventional therapy  Acupuncture is the insertion in the skin of thin needles  According to the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research  Mayo Clinic   a typical session entails lying still while approximately five to twenty needles are inserted  for the majority of cases  the needles will be left in place for ten to twenty minutes  It can be associated with the application of heat  pressure  or laser light  Classically  acupuncture is individualized and based on philosophy and intuition  and not on scientific research  There is also a non invasive therapy developed in early   th century Japan using an elaborate set of  needles  for the treatment of children  sh nishin or sh nihari   Clinical practice varies depending on the country  A comparison of the average number of patients treated per hour found significant differences between China      and the United States        Chinese herbs are often used  There is a diverse range of acupuncture approaches  involving different philosophies  Although various different techniques of acupuncture practice have emerged  the method used in traditional Chinese medicine  TCM  seems to be the most widely adopted in the US  Traditional acupuncture involves needle insertion  moxibustion  and cupping therapy  and may be accompanied by other procedures such as feeling the pulse and other parts of the body and examining the tongue  Traditional acupuncture involves the belief that a  life force   qi  circulates within the body in lines called meridians  The main methods practiced in the UK are TCM and Western medical acupuncture  The term Western medical acupuncture is used to indicate an adaptation of TCM based acupuncture which focuses less on TCM  The Western medical acupuncture approach involves using acupuncture after a medical diagnosis  Limited research has compared the contrasting acupuncture systems used in various countries for determining different acupuncture points and thus there is no defined standard for acupuncture points  In traditional acupuncture  the acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used  In TCM  the four diagnostic methods are  inspection  auscultation and olfaction  inquiring  and palpation  Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue  including analysis of the tongue size  shape  tension  color and coating  and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge  Auscultation and olfaction involves listening for particular sounds such as wheezing  and observing body odor  Inquiring involves focusing on the  seven inquiries   chills and fever  perspiration  appetite  thirst and taste  defecation and urination  pain  sleep  and menses and leukorrhea  Palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender  A shi  points and feeling the pulse        Needles      The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles  which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation  electroacupuncture   Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel  making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking  Needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination  Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications  Needles vary in length between    to     millimetres       to      in   with shorter needles used near the face and eyes  and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues  needle diameters vary from      mm        in  to      mm        in   with thicker needles used on more robust patients  Thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion  The tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage  although blunt needles cause more pain  Apart from the usual filiform needle  other needle types include three edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles  Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially  sometimes without penetrating the skin  and surrounded by a guide tube  a   th century invention adopted in China and the West   Korean acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand        Needling technique            Insertion      The skin is sterilized and needles are inserted  frequently with a plastic guide tube  Needles may be manipulated in various ways  including spinning  flicking  or moving up and down relative to the skin  Since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin  a quick insertion of the needle is recommended  Often the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull  localized  aching sensation that is called de qi  as well as  needle grasp   a tugging feeling felt by the acupuncturist and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin  Acupuncture can be painful  The skill level of the acupuncturist may influence how painful the needle insertion is  and a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain         De qi sensation      De qi  Chinese      pinyin  d  q    arrival of qi   refers to a sensation of numbness  distension  or electrical tingling at the needling site which might radiate along the corresponding meridian  If de qi can not be generated  then inaccurate location of the acupoint  improper depth of needle insertion  inadequate manual manipulation  or a very weak constitution of the patient can be considered  all of which are thought to decrease the likelihood of successful treatment  If the de qi sensation does not immediately occur upon needle insertion  various manual manipulation techniques can be applied to promote it  such as  plucking    shaking  or  trembling    Once de qi is achieved  further techniques might be utilized which aim to  influence  the de qi  for example  by certain manipulation the de qi sensation allegedly can be conducted from the needling site towards more distant sites of the body  Other techniques aim at  tonifying   Chinese     pinyin  b   or  sedating   Chinese     pinyin  xi   qi  The former techniques are used in deficiency patterns  the latter in excess patterns  De qi is more important in Chinese acupuncture  while Western and Japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment        Related practices     Acupressure  a non invasive form of bodywork  uses physical pressure applied to acupressure points by the hand or elbow  or with various devices  Acupuncture is often accompanied by moxibustion  the burning of cone shaped preparations of moxa  made from dried mugwort  on or near the skin  often but not always near or on an acupuncture point  Traditionally  acupuncture was used to treat acute conditions while moxibustion was used for chronic diseases  Moxibustion could be direct  the cone was placed directly on the skin and allowed to burn the skin  producing a blister and eventually a scar   or indirect  either a cone of moxa was placed on a slice of garlic  ginger or other vegetable  or a cylinder of moxa was held above the skin  close enough to either warm or burn it   Cupping therapy is an ancient Chinese form of alternative medicine in which a local suction is created on the skin  practitioners believe this mobilizes blood flow in order to promote healing  Tui na is a TCM method of attempting to stimulate the flow of qi by various bare handed techniques that do not involve needles  Electroacupuncture is a form of acupuncture in which acupuncture needles are attached to a device that generates continuous electric pulses  this has been described as  essentially transdermal electrical nerve stimulation  TENS  masquerading as acupuncture    Fire needle acupuncture also known as fire needling is a technique which involves quickly inserting a flame heated needle into areas on the body  Sonopuncture is a stimulation of the body similar to acupuncture using sound instead of needles  This may be done using purpose built transducers to direct a narrow ultrasound beam to a depth of     centimetres at acupuncture meridian points on the body  Alternatively  tuning forks or other sound emitting devices are used  Acupuncture point injection is the injection of various substances  such as drugs  vitamins or herbal extracts  into acupoints  Auriculotherapy  commonly known as ear acupuncture  auricular acupuncture  or auriculoacupuncture  is considered to date back to ancient China  It involves inserting needles to stimulate points on the outer ear  The modern approach was developed in France during the early     s  There is no scientific evidence that it can cure disease  the evidence of effectiveness is negligible  Scalp acupuncture  developed in Japan  is based on reflexological considerations regarding the scalp  Hand acupuncture  developed in Korea  centers around assumed reflex zones of the hand  Medical acupuncture attempts to integrate reflexological concepts  the trigger point model  and anatomical insights  such as dermatome distribution  into acupuncture practice  and emphasizes a more formulaic approach to acupuncture point location  Cosmetic acupuncture is the use of acupuncture in an attempt to reduce wrinkles on the face  Bee venom acupuncture is a treatment approach of injecting purified  diluted bee venom into acupoints  A      review of veterinary acupuncture found that there is insufficient evidence to  recommend or reject acupuncture for any condition in domestic animals   Rigorous evidence for complementary and alternative techniques is lacking in veterinary medicine but evidence has been growing       Effectiveness          Sham acupuncture and research     It is difficult but not impossible to design rigorous research trials for acupuncture  Due to acupuncture s invasive nature  one of the major challenges in efficacy research is in the design of an appropriate placebo control group  For efficacy studies to determine whether acupuncture has specific effects   sham  forms of acupuncture where the patient  practitioner  and analyst are blinded seem the most acceptable approach  Sham acupuncture uses non penetrating needles or needling at non acupuncture points  e g  inserting needles on meridians not related to the specific condition being studied  or in places not associated with meridians  The under performance of acupuncture in such trials may indicate that therapeutic effects are due entirely to non specific effects  or that the sham treatments are not inert  or that systematic protocols yield less than optimal treatment  A      Nature Reviews Cancer review article found that  contrary to the claimed mechanism of redirecting the flow of qi through meridians  researchers usually find that it generally does not matter where the needles are inserted  how often  that is  no dose response effect is observed   or even if needles are actually inserted  In other words   sham  or  placebo  acupuncture generally produces the same effects as  real  acupuncture and  in some cases  does better   A      meta analysis found little evidence that the effectiveness of acupuncture on pain  compared to sham  was modified by the location of the needles  the number of needles used  the experience or technique of the practitioner  or by the circumstances of the sessions  The same analysis also suggested that the number of needles and sessions is important  as greater numbers improved the outcomes of acupuncture compared to non acupuncture controls  There has been little systematic investigation of which components of an acupuncture session may be important for any therapeutic effect  including needle placement and depth  type and intensity of stimulation  and number of needles used  The research seems to suggest that needles do not need to stimulate the traditionally specified acupuncture points or penetrate the skin to attain an anticipated effect  e g  psychosocial factors   A response to  sham  acupuncture in osteoarthritis may be used in the elderly  but placebos have usually been regarded as deception and thus unethical  However  some physicians and ethicists have suggested circumstances for applicable uses for placebos such as it might present a theoretical advantage of an inexpensive treatment without adverse reactions or interactions with drugs or other medications  As the evidence for most types of alternative medicine such as acupuncture is far from strong  the use of alternative medicine in regular healthcare can present an ethical question  Using the principles of evidence based medicine to research acupuncture is controversial  and has produced different results  Some research suggests acupuncture can alleviate pain but the majority of research suggests that acupuncture s effects are mainly due to placebo  Evidence suggests that any benefits of acupuncture are short lasting  There is insufficient evidence to support use of acupuncture compared to mainstream medical treatments  Acupuncture is not better than mainstream treatment in the long term        Publication bias     Publication bias is cited as a concern in the reviews of randomized controlled trials  RCTs  of acupuncture  A      review of studies on acupuncture found that trials originating in China  Japan  Hong Kong  and Taiwan were uniformly favourable to acupuncture  as were ten out of eleven studies conducted in Russia  A      assessment of the quality of RCTs on TCM  including acupuncture  concluded that the methodological quality of most such trials  including randomization  experimental control  and blinding  was generally poor  particularly for trials published in Chinese journals  though the quality of acupuncture trials was better than the trials testing TCM remedies   The study also found that trials published in non Chinese journals tended to be of higher quality  Chinese authors use more Chinese studies  which have been demonstrated to be uniformly positive  A      review of    systematic reviews of acupuncture published in Chinese journals found that less than half of these reviews reported testing for publication bias  and that the majority of these reviews were published in journals with impact factors of zero  Scientist and journalist Steven Salzberg identifies acupuncture and Chinese medicine generally as a focus for  fake medical journals  such as the Journal of Acupuncture and Meridian Studies and Acupuncture in Medicine        Specific conditions            Pain      The conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent with each other  A      systematic review of systematic reviews found that for reducing pain  real acupuncture was no better than sham acupuncture  and concluded that numerous reviews have shown little convincing evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for reducing pain  The same review found that neck pain was one of only four types of pain for which a positive effect was suggested  but cautioned that the primary studies used carried a considerable risk of bias  A      overview of Cochrane reviews found acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions  and suggested that it may be effective for only chemotherapy induced nausea vomiting  postoperative nausea vomiting  and idiopathic headache  A      systematic review suggests that the nocebo effect of acupuncture is clinically relevant and that the rate of adverse events may be a gauge of the nocebo effect  According to the      Miller s Anesthesia book   when compared with placebo  acupuncture treatment has proven efficacy for relieving pain   A      meta analysis conducted by the Acupuncture Trialists  Collaboration found  relatively modest  efficiency of acupuncture  in comparison to sham  for the treatment of four different types of chronic pain  back and neck pain  knee osteoarthritis  chronic headache  and shoulder pain  and on that basis concluded that it  is more than a placebo  and a reasonable referral option  Commenting on this meta analysis  both Edzard Ernst and David Colquhoun said the results were of negligible clinical significance  Edzard Ernst later stated that  I fear that  once we manage to eliminate this bias  that operators are not blind    we might find that the effects of acupuncture exclusively are a placebo response   A      systematic review suggested that acupuncture is more than a placebo for commonly occurring chronic pain conditions  but the authors acknowledged that it is still unknown if the overall benefit is clinically meaningful or cost effective  A      review found real acupuncture and sham acupuncture produce similar improvements  which can only be accepted as evidence against the efficacy of acupuncture  The same review found limited evidence that real acupuncture and sham acupuncture appear to produce biological differences despite similar effects  A      systematic review and meta analysis found that acupuncture had a small analgesic effect  which appeared to lack any clinical importance and could not be discerned from bias  The same review found that it remains unclear whether acupuncture reduces pain independent of a psychological impact of the needling ritual  A      Cochrane review found moderate quality evidence that real acupuncture was more effective than sham acupuncture or inactive for short term relief of neck pain measured either upon completion of treatment or at short term follow up         Low back pain      A      systematic review found that acupuncture may be effective for nonspecific lower back pain  but the authors noted there were limitations in the studies examined  such as heterogeneity in study characteristics and low methodological quality in many studies  A      systematic review found some supporting evidence that acupuncture was more effective than no treatment for chronic non specific low back pain  the evidence was conflicting comparing the effectiveness over other treatment approaches  A      systematic review of systematic reviews found that  for chronic low back pain  individualized acupuncture is not better in reducing symptoms than formula acupuncture or sham acupuncture with a toothpick that does not penetrate the skin   A      review found that sham acupuncture was as effective as real acupuncture for chronic low back pain  The specific therapeutic effects of acupuncture were small  whereas its clinically relevant benefits were mostly due to contextual and psychosocial circumstances  Brain imaging studies have shown that traditional acupuncture and sham acupuncture differ in their effect on limbic structures  while at the same time showed equivalent analgesic effects  A      Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against either acupuncture or dry needling for acute low back pain  The same review found low quality evidence for pain relief and improvement compared to no treatment or sham therapy for chronic low back pain only in the short term immediately after treatment  The same review also found that acupuncture is not more effective than conventional therapy and other alternative medicine treatments  A      systematic review for an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline found low to moderate evidence that acupuncture was effective for chronic low back pain  and limited evidence that it was effective for acute low back pain  The same review found that the strength of the evidence for both conditions was low to moderate         Headaches and migraines      Two separate      Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture could be useful in the prophylaxis of tension type headaches and episodic migraines  The      Cochrane review evaluating acupuncture for episodic migraine prevention concluded that true acupuncture had a small effect beyond sham acupuncture and found moderate quality evidence to suggest that acupuncture is at least similarly effective to prophylactic medications for this purpose  A      review found that acupuncture has demonstrated benefit for the treatment of headaches  but that safety needed to be more fully documented in order to make any strong recommendations in support of its use  A      Cochrane review of the use of acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis treatment concluded that  true  acupuncture was no more efficient than sham acupuncture  but  true  acupuncture appeared to be as effective as  or possibly more effective than routine care in the treatment of migraines  with fewer adverse effects than prophylactic drug treatment  The same review stated that the specific points chosen to needle may be of limited importance  A      Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support acupuncture for tension type headaches  The same review found evidence that suggested that acupuncture might be considered a helpful non pharmacological approach for frequent episodic or chronic tension type headache         Arthritis pain      A      review concluded that  current evidence supports the use of acupuncture as an alternative to traditional analgesics in osteoarthritis patients   As of       a meta analysis showed that acupuncture may help osteoarthritis pain but it was noted that the effects were insignificant in comparison to sham needles  A      systematic review and network meta analysis found that the evidence suggests that acupuncture may be considered one of the more effective physical treatments for alleviating pain due to knee osteoarthritis in the short term compared to other relevant physical treatments  though much of the evidence in the topic is of poor quality and there is uncertainty about the efficacy of many of the treatments  A      review found  the potential beneficial action of acupuncture on osteoarthritis pain does not appear to be clinically relevant   A      Cochrane review found that acupuncture shows statistically significant benefit over sham acupuncture in the treatment of peripheral joint osteoarthritis  however  these benefits were found to be so small that their clinical significance was doubtful  and  probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding   A      Cochrane review found low to moderate evidence that acupuncture improves pain and stiffness in treating people with fibromyalgia compared with no treatment and standard care  A      review found  there is insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture for the treatment of fibromyalgia   A      systematic review found a small pain relief effect that was not apparently discernible from bias  acupuncture is not a recommendable treatment for the management of fibromyalgia on the basis of this review  A      review found that the effectiveness of acupuncture to treat rheumatoid arthritis is  sparse and inconclusive   A      Cochrane review concluded that acupuncture use to treat rheumatoid arthritis  has no effect on ESR  CRP  pain  patient s global assessment  number of swollen joints  number of tender joints  general health  disease activity and reduction of analgesics   A      overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture in the treatment of most rheumatic conditions  with the exceptions of osteoarthritis  low back pain  and lateral elbow pain         Other joint pain      A      systematic review found that although manual acupuncture was effective at relieving short term pain when used to treat tennis elbow  its long term effect in relieving pain was  unremarkable   A      review found that acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture at treating chronic knee pain  the evidence was not conclusive due to the lack of large  high quality trials         Post operative pain and nausea      A      overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting  PONV  in a clinical setting  A      systematic review concluded that acupuncture might be beneficial in prevention and treatment of PONV  A      Cochrane review found that stimulation of the P  acupoint on the wrist was as effective  or ineffective  as antiemetic drugs and was associated with minimal side effects  The same review found  no reliable evidence for differences in risks of postoperative nausea or vomiting after P  acupoint stimulation compared to antiemetic drugs   A      overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to suggest that acupuncture is effective for surgical or post operative pain  For the use of acupuncture for post operative pain  there was contradictory evidence  A      systematic review found supportive but limited evidence for use of acupuncture for acute post operative pain after back surgery  A      systematic review found that while the evidence suggested acupuncture could be an effective treatment for postoperative gastroparesis  a firm conclusion could not be reached because the trials examined were of low quality         Pain and nausea associated with cancer and cancer treatment      A      Cochrane review found that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture is an effective treatment for cancer pain in adults  A      systematic review found that acupuncture may be effective as an adjunctive treatment to palliative care for cancer patients  A      overview of reviews found evidence that acupuncture could be beneficial for people with cancer related symptoms  but also identified few rigorous trials and high heterogeneity between trials  A      systematic review of randomised clinical trials  RCTs  using acupuncture in the treatment of cancer pain found that the number and quality of RCTs was too low to draw definite conclusions  A      systematic review reached inconclusive results with regard to the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating cancer related fatigue  A      systematic review found that acupuncture is an acceptable adjunctive treatment for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  but that further research with a low risk of bias is needed  A      systematic review found that the quantity and quality of available RCTs for analysis were too low to draw valid conclusions for the effectiveness of acupuncture for cancer related fatigue  A      systematic review and meta analysis found very limited evidence regarding acupuncture compared with conventional intramuscular injections for the treatment of hiccups in cancer patients  The methodological quality and amount of RCTs in the review was low         Sleep      A      systematic review and meta analysis found that acupuncture was  associated with a significant reduction in sleep disturbances in women experiencing menopause related sleep disturbances          Other conditions      For the following conditions  the Cochrane Collaboration or other reviews have concluded there is no strong evidence of benefit  alcohol dependence  angina pectoris  ankle sprain  Alzheimer s disease  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  autism  asthma  bell s palsy  traumatic brain injury  carpal tunnel syndrome  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  cardiac arrhythmias  cerebral hemorrhage  cocaine dependence  constipation  depression  diabetic peripheral neuropathy  drug detoxification  dry eye  primary dysmenorrhoea  enuresis  endometriosis  epilepsy  erectile dysfunction  essential hypertension  glaucoma  gynaecological conditions  except possibly fertility and nausea vomiting   acute hordeolum  hot flashes  insomnia  induction of childbirth  irritable bowel syndrome  labor pain  lumbar spinal stenosis  major depressive disorders in pregnant women  musculoskeletal disorders of the extremities  myopia  obesity  obstetrical conditions  polycystic ovary syndrome  posttraumatic stress disorder  premenstrual syndrome  preoperative anxiety  opioid addiction  restless legs syndrome  schizophrenia  sensorineural hearing loss  smoking cessation  stress urinary incontinence  acute stroke  stroke rehabilitation  temporomandibular joint dysfunction  tennis elbow  labor induction  tinnitus  uremic itching  uterine fibroids  vascular dementia  whiplash   stroke  Parkinson s disease  dyspepsia  and in vitro fertilization  IVF   and allergy        Moxibustion and cupping     A      overview of systematic reviews found that moxibustion was effective for several conditions but the primary studies were of poor quality  so there persists ample uncertainty  which limits the conclusiveness of their findings       Safety          Adverse events     Acupuncture is generally safe when administered by an experienced  appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and sterile single use needles  When improperly delivered it can cause adverse effects  Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect on the part of the practitioner  To reduce the risk of serious adverse events after acupuncture  acupuncturists should be trained sufficiently  People with serious spinal disease  such as cancer or infection  are not good candidates for acupuncture  Contraindications to acupuncture  conditions that should not be treated with acupuncture  include coagulopathy disorders  e g  hemophilia and advanced liver disease   warfarin use  severe psychiatric disorders  e g  psychosis   and skin infections or skin trauma  e g  burns   Further  electroacupuncture should be avoided at the spot of implanted electrical devices  such as pacemakers   A      systematic review of systematic reviews  internationally and without language restrictions  found that serious complications following acupuncture continue to be reported  Between      and       ninety five cases of serious adverse events  including five deaths  were reported  Many such events are not inherent to acupuncture but are due to malpractice of acupuncturists  This might be why such complications have not been reported in surveys of adequately trained acupuncturists  Most such reports originate from Asia  which may reflect the large number of treatments performed there or a relatively higher number of poorly trained Asian acupuncturists  Many serious adverse events were reported from developed countries  These included Australia  Austria  Canada  Croatia  France  Germany  Ireland  the Netherlands  New Zealand  Spain  Sweden  Switzerland  the UK  and the US  The number of adverse effects reported from the UK appears particularly unusual  which may indicate less under reporting in the UK than other countries  Reports included    cases of infections and    cases of organ trauma  The most frequent adverse events included pneumothorax  and bacterial and viral infections  A      review found  without restrictions regarding publication date  study type or language      cases of infections  mycobacterium was the pathogen in at least      Likely sources of infection include towels  hot packs or boiling tank water  and reusing reprocessed needles  Possible sources of infection include contaminated needles  reusing personal needles  a person s skin containing mycobacterium  and reusing needles at various sites in the same person  Although acupuncture is generally considered a safe procedure  a      review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade  including those of mycobacterium  Although it is recommended that practitioners of acupuncture use disposable needles  the reuse of sterilized needles is still permitted  It is also recommended that thorough control practices for preventing infection be implemented and adapted         English language      A      systematic review of the English language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare  but that acupuncture is not without risk  Between      and      the English language literature from    countries and regions reported     adverse events  The majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor  and the incidences were low  For example  a prospective survey of        acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and    minor ones  a rate of     per      interventions  Another survey found there were      minor adverse events  of which   were serious  amid        acupuncture patients  The most common adverse effect observed was infection  e g  mycobacterium   and the majority of infections were bacterial in nature  caused by skin contact at the needling site  Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting  Other adverse complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries  e g  migrating broken needles or needling too deeply   four brain injuries  four peripheral nerve injuries  five heart injuries  seven other organ and tissue injuries  bilateral hand edema  epithelioid granuloma  pseudolymphoma  argyria  pustules  pancytopenia  and scarring due to hot needle technique  Adverse reactions from acupuncture  which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice  included syncope  galactorrhoea  bilateral nystagmus  pyoderma gangrenosum  hepatotoxicity  eruptive lichen planus  and spontaneous needle migration  A      systematic review found    cases of vascular injuries caused by acupuncture  three resulting in death  Two died from pericardial tamponade and one was from an aortoduodenal fistula  The same review found vascular injuries were rare  bleeding and pseudoaneurysm were most prevalent  A      systematic review  without restriction in time or language   aiming to summarize all reported case of cardiac tamponade after acupuncture  found    cases resulting in    deaths  with little doubt about causality in most fatal instances  The same review concluded cardiac tamponade was a serious  usually fatal  though theoretically avoidable complication following acupuncture  and urged training to minimize risk  A      review found a number of adverse events were reported after acupuncture in the UK s National Health Service  NHS  but most       were not severe  though miscategorization and under reporting may alter the total figures  From January      to December           safety incidents were recognized within the NHS organizations  The adverse events recorded included retained needles        dizziness        loss of consciousness unresponsive        falls       bruising or soreness at needle site       pneumothorax      and other adverse side effects        Acupuncture practitioners should know  and be prepared to be responsible for  any substantial harm from treatments  Some acupuncture proponents argue that the long history of acupuncture suggests it is safe  However  there is an increasing literature on adverse events  e g  spinal cord injury   Acupuncture seems to be safe in people getting anticoagulants  assuming needles are used at the correct location and depth  Studies are required to verify these findings  The evidence suggests that acupuncture might be a safe option for people with allergic rhinitis         Chinese  South Korean  and Japanese language      A      systematic review of the Chinese language literature found numerous acupuncture related adverse events  including pneumothorax  fainting  subarachnoid hemorrhage  and infection as the most frequent  and cardiovascular injuries  subarachnoid hemorrhage  pneumothorax  and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious  most of which were due to improper technique  Between      and       the Chinese language literature reported     adverse events  Prospective surveys show that mild  transient acupuncture associated adverse events ranged from       to      In a study with         patients  the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly         Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of             incidences among         patients  Infections  mainly hepatitis  after acupuncture are reported often in English language research  though are rarely reported in Chinese language research  making it plausible that acupuncture associated infections have been underreported in China  Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles  Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma  in the cervical  thoracic and lumbar spine   chylothorax  injuries of abdominal organs and tissues  injuries in the neck region  injuries to the eyes  including orbital hemorrhage  traumatic cataract  injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture  hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis  peripheral motor nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction  local allergic reactions to metal needles  stroke  and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture  A causal link between acupuncture and the adverse events cardiac arrest  pyknolepsy  shock  fever  cough  thirst  aphonia  leg numbness  and sexual dysfunction remains uncertain  The same review concluded that acupuncture can be considered inherently safe when practiced by properly trained practitioners  but the review also stated there is a need to find effective strategies to minimize the health risks  Between      and       the Republic of Korean literature contained reports of      adverse events  Between the     s and       the Japanese language literature contained reports of     adverse events         Children and pregnancy      Although acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years in China  its use in pediatrics in the United States did not become common until the early     s  In       the National Health Interview Survey  NHIS  conducted by the National Center For Health Statistics  NCHS  estimated that approximately         children had received acupuncture treatment for a variety of conditions  Acupuncture can potentially improve a number of common pediatric issues  including gastrointestinal issues  reflux  colic  asthma  allergies  ADHD  and headaches  however  its safety has been debated  In      a study determined that the use of acupuncture needle treatment on children was  questionable  due to the possibility of adverse side effects and the pain manifestation differences in children versus adults  The study also includes warnings against practicing acupuncture on infants  as well as on children who are over fatigued  very weak  or have over eaten  When used on children  acupuncture is considered safe when administered by well trained  licensed practitioners using sterile needles  however  a      review found there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture  The same review found     adverse events     of them serious  The adverse events were mostly mild in nature  e g  bruising or bleeding   The prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from       to        an estimated     incidences among       patients  On rare occasions adverse events were serious  e g  cardiac rupture or hemoptysis   many might have been a result of substandard practice  The incidence of serious adverse events was   per one million  which included children and adults  When used during pregnancy  the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient  with few serious adverse events  The most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain  followed by bleeding  Although two deaths  one stillbirth and one neonatal death  were reported  there was a lack of acupuncture associated maternal mortality  Limiting the evidence as certain  probable or possible in the causality evaluation  the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was     per         Although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women  some specific acupuncture points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion  these spots  as well as the abdominal region  should be avoided during pregnancy         Moxibustion and cupping      Four adverse events associated with moxibustion were bruising  burns and cellulitis  spinal epidural abscess  and large superficial basal cell carcinoma  Ten adverse events were associated with cupping  The minor ones were keloid scarring  burns  and bullae  the serious ones were acquired hemophilia A  stroke following cupping on the back and neck  factitious panniculitis  reversible cardiac hypertrophy  and iron deficiency anemia        Cost effectiveness     A      meta analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost effective as a complement to standard care  but not as a substitute for standard care except in cases where comorbid depression presented  The same meta analysis found there was no difference between sham and non sham acupuncture  A      systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain  A      systematic review found that the cost effectiveness of acupuncture could not be concluded  A      review found that acupuncture seems to be cost effective for some pain conditions        Risk of forgoing conventional medical care     As with other alternative medicines  unethical or na ve practitioners may induce patients to exhaust financial resources by pursuing ineffective treatment  Profession ethical codes set by accrediting organizations such as the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine require practitioners to make  timely referrals to other health care professionals as may be appropriate   Stephen Barrett states that there is a  risk that an acupuncturist whose approach to diagnosis is not based on scientific concepts will fail to diagnose a dangerous condition        Conceptual basis          Traditional      Acupuncture is a substantial part of traditional Chinese medicine  TCM   Early acupuncture beliefs relied on concepts that are common in TCM  such as a life force energy called qi  Qi was believed to flow from the body s primary organs  zang fu organs  to the  superficial  body tissues of the skin  muscles  tendons  bones  and joints  through channels called meridians  Acupuncture points where needles are inserted are mainly  but not always  found at locations along the meridians  Acupuncture points not found along a meridian are called extraordinary points and those with no designated site are called  A shi  points  In TCM  disease is generally perceived as a disharmony or imbalance in energies such as yin  yang  qi  xu   z ng f   meridians  and of the interaction between the body and the environment  Therapy is based on which  pattern of disharmony  can be identified  For example  some diseases are believed to be caused by meridians being invaded with an excess of wind  cold  and damp  In order to determine which pattern is at hand  practitioners examine things like the color and shape of the tongue  the relative strength of pulse points  the smell of the breath  the quality of breathing  or the sound of the voice  TCM and its concept of disease does not strongly differentiate between the cause and effect of symptoms        Purported scientific basis      Scientific research has not supported the existence of qi  meridians  or yin and yang  A Nature editorial described TCM as  fraught with pseudoscience   with the majority of its treatments having no logical mechanism of action  Quackwatch states that  TCM theory and practice are not based upon the body of knowledge related to health  disease  and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community  TCM practitioners disagree among themselves about how to diagnose patients and which treatments should go with which diagnoses  Even if they could agree  the TCM theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable TCM to offer rational care   Some modern practitioners support the use of acupuncture to treat pain  but have abandoned the use of qi  meridians  yin  yang and other energies based in mysticism  as explanatory frameworks  The use of qi as an explanatory framework has been decreasing in China  even as it becomes more prominent during discussions of acupuncture in the US  Academic discussions of acupuncture still make reference to pseudoscientific concepts such as qi and meridians despite the lack of scientific evidence  Many within the scientific community consider attempts to rationalize acupuncture in science to be quackery  pseudoscience and  theatrical placebo   Academics Massimo Pigliucci and Maarten Boudry describe it as a  borderlands science  lying between science and pseudoscience  Many acupuncturists attribute pain relief to the release of endorphins when needles penetrate  but no longer support the idea that acupuncture can affect a disease  It is a generally held belief within the acupuncture community that acupuncture points and meridians structures are special conduits for electrical signals but no research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either acupuncture points or meridians  Human tests to determine whether electrical continuity was significantly different near meridians than other places in the body have been inconclusive  Some studies suggest acupuncture causes a series of events within the central nervous system  and that it is possible to inhibit acupuncture s analgesic effects with the opioid antagonist naloxone  Mechanical deformation of the skin by acupuncture needles appears to result in the release of adenosine  The anti nociceptive effect of acupuncture may be mediated by the adenosine A  receptor  A      Nature Reviews Cancer review article found that since the key mouse studies that suggested acupuncture relieves pain via the local release of adenosine  which then triggered close by A  receptors  caused more tissue damage and inflammation relative to the size of the animal in mice than in humans  such studies unnecessarily muddled a finding that local inflammation can result in the local release of adenosine with analgesic effect   It has been proposed that acupuncture s effects in gastrointestinal disorders may relate to its effects on the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system  which have been said to be the  Western medicine  equivalent of  yin and yang   Another mechanism whereby acupuncture may be effective for gastrointestinal dysfunction involves the promotion of gastric peristalsis in subjects with low initial gastric motility  and suppressing peristalsis in subjects with active initial motility  Acupuncture has also been found to exert anti inflammatory effects  which may be mediated by the activation of the vagus nerve and deactivation of inflammatory macrophages  Neuroimaging studies suggest that acupuncture stimulation results in deactivation of the limbic brain areas and the default mode network       History          Origins      Acupuncture  along with moxibustion  is one of the oldest practices of Traditional Chinese Medicine  Most historians believe the practice began in China  though there are some conflicting narratives on when it originated  Academics David Ramey and Paul Buell said the exact date acupuncture was founded depends on the extent dating of ancient texts can be trusted and the interpretation of what constitutes acupuncture  According to an article in Rheumatology  the first documentation of an  organized system of diagnosis and treatment  for acupuncture was in The Yellow Emperor s Classic of Internal Medicine  Huangdi Neijing  from about     BC  Gold and silver needles found in the tomb of Liu Sheng from around     BC are believed to be the earliest archeological evidence of acupuncture  though it is unclear if that was their purpose  According to Dr  Plinio Prioreschi  the earliest known historical record of acupuncture is the Shih Chi   Record of History    written by a historian around     BC  It is believed that this text was documenting what was established practice at that time         Alternate theories      The       year old mummified body of  tzi the Iceman was found with    groups of tattoos  many of which were located at points on the body where acupuncture needles are used for abdominal or lower back problems  Evidence from the body suggests Otzi suffered from these conditions  This has been cited as evidence that practices similar to acupuncture may have been practiced elsewhere in Eurasia during the early Bronze Age  however  The Oxford Handbook of the History of Medicine calls this theory  speculative   It is considered unlikely that acupuncture was practiced before      BC  The  tzi the Iceman s tattoo marks suggest to some experts that an acupuncture like treatment was previously used in Europe   millennia ago  Acupuncture may have been practiced during the Neolithic era  near the end of the stone age  using sharpened stones called Bian shi  Many Chinese texts from later eras refer to sharp stones called  plen   which means  stone probe   that may have been used for acupuncture purposes  The ancient Chinese medical text  Huangdi Neijing  indicates that sharp stones were believed at the time to cure illnesses at or near the body s surface  perhaps because of the short depth a stone could penetrate  However  it is more likely that stones were used for other medical purposes  such as puncturing a growth to drain its pus  The Mawangdui texts  which are believed to be from the  nd century BC  mention the use of pointed stones to open abscesses  and moxibustion  but not for acupuncture  It is also speculated that these stones may have been used for bloodletting  due to the ancient Chinese belief that illnesses were caused by demons within the body that could be killed or released  It is likely bloodletting was an antecedent to acupuncture  According to historians Lu Gwei djen and Joseph Needham  there is substantial evidence that acupuncture may have begun around     BC  Some hieroglyphs and pictographs from that era suggests acupuncture and moxibustion were practiced  However  historians Gwei djen and Needham said it was unlikely a needle could be made out of the materials available in China during this time period  It is possible Bronze was used for early acupuncture needles  Tin  copper  gold and silver are also possibilities  though they are considered less likely  or to have been used in fewer cases  If acupuncture was practiced during the Shang dynasty       to      BC   organic materials like thorns  sharpened bones  or bamboo may have been used  Once methods for producing steel were discovered  it would replace all other materials  since it could be used to create a very fine  but sturdy needles  Gwei djen and Needham noted that all the ancient materials that could have been used for acupuncture and which often produce archeological evidence  such as sharpened bones  bamboo or stones  were also used for other purposes  An article in Rheumatology said that the absence of any mention of acupuncture in documents found in the tomb of Ma Wang Dui from     BC suggest that acupuncture was not practiced by that time         Belief systems      Several different and sometimes conflicting belief systems emerged regarding acupuncture  This may have been the result of competing schools of thought  Some ancient texts referred to using acupuncture to cause bleeding  while others mixed the ideas of blood letting and spiritual ch i energy  Over time  the focus shifted from blood to the concept of puncturing specific points on the body  and eventually to balancing Yin and Yang energies as well  According to Dr  David Ramey  no single  method or theory  was ever predominantly adopted as the standard  At the time  scientific knowledge of medicine was not yet developed  especially because in China dissection of the deceased was forbidden  preventing the development of basic anatomical knowledge  It is not certain when specific acupuncture points were introduced  but the autobiography of Pien Chhio from around         BC references inserting needles at designated areas  Bian Que believed there was a single acupuncture point at the top of one s skull that he called the point  of the hundred meetings   Texts dated to be from         BC document early beliefs in channels of life force energy called meridians that would later be an element in early acupuncture beliefs  Ramey and Buell said the  practice and theoretical underpinnings  of modern acupuncture were introduced in the The Yellow Emperor s Classic  Huangdi Neijing  around     BC  It introduced the concept of using acupuncture to manipulate the flow of life energy  qi  in a network of meridian  channels  in the body  The network concept was made up of acu tracts  such as a line down the arms  where it said acupoints were located  Some of the sites acupuncturists use needles at today still have the same names as those given to them by the Yellow Emporer s Classic  Numerous additional documents were published over the centuries introducing new acupoints  By the  th century AD  most of the acupuncture sites in use today had been named and identified        Early development in China            Establishment and growth      In the first half of the  st century AD  acupuncturists began promoting the belief that acupuncture s effectiveness was influenced by the time of day or night  the lunar cycle  and the season  The Science of the Yin Yang Cycles  Y n Chhi Hs eh  was a set of beliefs that curing diseases relied on the alignment of both heavenly  thien  and earthly  ti  forces that were attuned to cycles like that of the sun and moon  There were several different belief systems that relied on a number of celestial and earthly bodies or elements that rotated and only became aligned at certain times  According to Needham and Gwei djen  these  arbitrary predictions  were depicted by acupuncturists in complex charts and through a set of special terminology  Acupuncture needles during this period were much thicker than most modern ones and often resulted in infection  Infection is caused by a lack of sterilization  but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle  or needling in the wrong place  or at the wrong time  Later  many needles were heated in boiling water  or in a flame  Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot  creating a cauterizing effect at the injection site  Nine needles were recommended in the Chen Chiu Ta Chheng from       which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number  Other belief systems were based on the idea that the human body operated on a rhythm and acupuncture had to be applied at the right point in the rhythm to be effective  In some cases a lack of balance between Yin and Yang were believed to be the cause of disease  In the  st century AD  many of the first books about acupuncture were published and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge  The Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing  which was published in the mid  rd century  became the oldest acupuncture book that is still in existence in the modern era  Other books like the Yu Kuei Chen Ching  written by the Director of Medical Services for China  were also influential during this period  but were not preserved  In the mid  th century  Sun Simiao published acupuncture related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding acupuncture sites on people of different sizes and categorized acupuncture sites in a set of modules  Acupuncture became more established in China as improvements in paper led to the publication of more acupuncture books  The Imperial Medical Service and the Imperial Medical College  which both supported acupuncture  became more established and created medical colleges in every province  The public was also exposed to stories about royal figures being cured of their diseases by prominent acupuncturists  By time The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion was published during the Ming dynasty            AD   most of the acupuncture practices used in the modern era had been established         Decline      By the end of the Song dynasty       AD   acupuncture had lost much of its status in China  It became rarer in the following centuries  and was associated with less prestigious professions like alchemy  shamanism  midwifery and moxibustion  Additionally  by the   th century  scientific rationality was becoming more popular than traditional superstitious beliefs  By      a book documenting the history of Chinese medicine called acupuncture a  lost art   Its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications  as well as its association with the lower classes  In       the Chinese Emperor signed a decree excluding the practice of acupuncture from the Imperial Medical Institute  He said it was unfit for practice by gentlemen scholars  In China acupuncture was increasingly associated with lower class  illiterate practitioners  It was restored for a time  but banned again in      in favor of science based Western medicine  Although acupuncture declined in China during this time period  it was also growing in popularity in other countries        International expansion      Korea is believed to be the first country in Asia that acupuncture spread to outside of China  Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor Dangun  though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture in     AD  Acupuncture use was commonplace in Korea by the  th century  It spread to Vietnam in the  th and  th centuries  As Vietnam began trading with Japan and China around the  th century  it was influenced by their acupuncture practices as well  China and Korea sent  medical missionaries  that spread traditional Chinese medicine to Japan  starting around     AD  In      several Korean and Chinese citizens were appointed to re organize medical education in Japan and they incorporated acupuncture as part of that system  Japan later sent students back to China and established acupuncture as one of five divisions of the Chinese State Medical Administration System  Acupuncture began to spread to Europe in the second half of the   th century  Around this time the surgeon general of the Dutch East India Company met Japanese and Chinese acupuncture practitioners and later encouraged Europeans to further investigate it  He published the first in depth description of acupuncture for the European audience and created the term  acupuncture  in his      work De Acupunctura  France was an early adopter among the West due to the influence of Jesuit missionaries  who brought the practice to French clinics in the   th century  The French doctor Louis Berlioz  the father of the composer Hector Berlioz  is usually credited with being the first to experiment with the procedure in Europe in       before publishing his findings in       By the   th century  acupuncture had become commonplace in many areas of the world  Americans and Britons began showing interest in acupuncture in the early   th century but interest waned by mid century  Western practitioners abandoned acupuncture s traditional beliefs in spiritual energy  pulse diagnosis  and the cycles of the moon  sun or the body s rhythm  Diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy  for example  conflicted with the West s own anatomical diagrams  It adopted a new set of ideas for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves  In Europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the flow of electricity in the body  as electrical pulses were found to make a frog s leg twitch after death  The West eventually created a belief system based on Travell trigger points that were believed to inhibit pain  They were in the same locations as China s spiritually identified acupuncture points  but under a different nomenclature  The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in      by Willem ten Rhijne         Modern era      In China  the popularity of acupuncture rebounded in      when Mao Zedong took power and sought to unite China behind traditional cultural values  It was also during this time that many Eastern medical practices were consolidated under the name Traditional Chinese Medicine  TCM   New practices were adopted in the   th century  such as using a cluster of needles  electrified needles  or leaving needles inserted for up to a week  A lot of emphasis developed on using acupuncture on the ear  Acupuncture research organizations were founded in the     s and acupuncture services became available in modern hospitals  China  where acupuncture was believed to have originated  was increasingly influenced by Western medicine  Meanwhile  acupuncture grew in popularity in the US  The US Congress created the Office of Alternative Medicine in      and the National Institutes of Health  NIH  declared support for acupuncture for some conditions in November       In       the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine was created within the NIH  Acupuncture became the most popular alternative medicine in the US  Politicians from the Chinese Communist Party said acupuncture was superstitious and conflicted with the party s commitment to science  Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong later reversed this position  arguing that the practice was based on scientific principles  In       a New York Times reporter published an article on his acupuncture experiences in China  which led to more investigation of and support for acupuncture  The US President Richard Nixon visited China in       During one part of the visit  the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake  ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than anesthesia  Later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high pain tolerance and received heavy indoctrination before the operation  these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving morphine surreptitiously through an intravenous drip that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients  One patient receiving open heart surgery while awake was ultimately found to have received a combination of three powerful sedatives as well as large injections of a local anesthetic into the wound  After the National Institute of Health expressed support for acupuncture for a limited number of conditions  adoption in the US grew further  In      the first legal acupuncture center in the US was established in Washington DC and in      the American Internal Revenue Service allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense  In       a BBC documentary Alternative Medicine filmed a patient undergoing open heart surgery allegedly under acupuncture induced anesthesia  It was later revealed that the patient had been given a cocktail of anesthetics  In       UNESCO inscribed  acupuncture and moxibustion of traditional Chinese medicine  on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List following China s nomination       Adoption    Acupuncture is popular in China  the US  Australia  and Europe including all five Nordic countries  though less so in Finland  It is most heavily practiced in China and is one of the most common alternative medicine practices in Europe  In Switzerland  acupuncture has become the most frequently used alternative medicine since       In the United Kingdom  a total of   million acupuncture treatments were administered in       Acupuncture is used in most pain clinics and hospices in the UK  An estimated   in    adults in Australia used acupuncture in       In Japan  it is estimated that    percent of the population will try acupuncture at some point  though in most cases it is not covered by public health insurance  Users of acupuncture in Japan are more likely to be elderly and to have a limited education  Approximately half of users surveyed indicated a likelihood to seek such remedies in the future  while     did not  Less than one percent of the US population reported having used acupuncture in the early     s  By the early     s  more than    million Americans reported having used acupuncture as part of their health care  In the US  acupuncture is increasingly  as of       used at academic medical centers  and is usually offered through CAM centers or anesthesia and pain management services  Examples include those at Harvard University  Stanford University  Johns Hopkins University  and UCLA  This usage has been criticized owing to there being little scientific evidence for explicit effects  or the mechanisms for its supposed effectiveness  for any condition that is discernible from placebo  Acupuncture has been called  theatrical placebo   and David Gorski argues that when acupuncture proponents advocate  harnessing of placebo effects  or work on developing  meaningful placebos   they essentially concede it is little more than that  The use of acupuncture in Germany increased by     in       after the German acupuncture trials supported its efficacy for certain uses  In       there were more than one million users  and insurance companies have estimated that two thirds of German users are women  As a result of the trials  German public health insurers began to cover acupuncture for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee  but not tension headache or migraine  This decision was based in part on socio political reasons  Some insurers in Germany chose to stop reimbursement of acupuncture because of the trials  For other conditions  insurers in Germany were not convinced that acupuncture had adequate benefits over usual care or sham treatments  Highlighting the results of the placebo group  researchers refused to accept a placebo therapy as efficient       Regulation     There are various government and trade association regulatory bodies for acupuncture in the United Kingdom  the United States  Saudi Arabia  Australia  Japan  Canada  and in European countries and elsewhere  The World Health Organization recommends that before being licensed or certified  an acupuncturist receive     hours of specialized training if they are a physician and       hours for non physicians  many governments have adopted similar standards  In China  the practice of acupuncture is regulated by the Chinese Medicine Council that was formed in      by the Legislative Council  It includes a licensing exam and registration  as well as degree courses approved by the board  Canada has acupuncture licensing programs in the provinces of British Columbia  Ontario  Alberta and Quebec  standards set by the Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada are used in provinces without government regulation  Regulation in the US began in the     s in California  which was eventually followed by every state but Wyoming and Idaho  Licensing requirements vary greatly from state to state  The needles used in acupuncture are regulated in the US by the Food and Drug Administration  In some states acupuncture is regulated by a board of medical examiners  while in others by the board of licensing  health or education  In Japan  acupuncturists are licensed by the Minister of Health  Labour and Welfare after passing an examination and graduating from a technical school or university  Australia regulates Chinese medical traditions through the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia and the Public Health  Skin Penetration  Regulation of       It restricts the use of words like  Acupuncture  and  Registered Acupuncturist   At least    countries in Europe have professional associations for acupuncturists  In France  the Acad mie Nationale de M decine  National Academy of Medicine  has regulated acupuncture since            See also         Bibliography    Aung  SKH  Chen WPD         Clinical Introduction to Medical Acupuncture  Thieme Medical
