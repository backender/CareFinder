Alternative Therapies in Health and MedicineAlternative Therapies in Health and Medicine is a bimonthly peer reviewed medical journal covering alternative medical treatments  It publishes case reports  original research papers  and systematic reviews  It was established in      by founding editor Larry Dossey and is published bimonthly by InnoVision Health Media  The current editor in chief is Andrew W  Campbell Osteopathic medicineOsteopathic medicine is a branch of the medical profession practiced primarily in the United States  but has also spread into other countries  notably Canada  Osteopathic physicians  D O s  are equivalent to Doctors of Medicine  M D s  and are considered fully licensed physicians  medical doctors  to practice medicine and surgery in all    states and are recognized in    other countries  including all Canadian provinces PubMedPubMed is a free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics  The United States National Library of Medicine  NLM  at the National Institutes of Health maintains the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval  From      to       MEDLINE online access to the MEDLARS Online computerized database primarily had been through institutional facilities  such as university libraries  PubMed  first released in January       ushered in the era of private  free  home  and office based MEDLINE searching  The PubMed system was offered free to the public in June       when MEDLINE searches via the Web were demonstrated  in a ceremony  by Vice President Al Gore Activities of daily livingActivities of daily living  ADLs or ADL  is a term used in healthcare to refer to people s daily self care activities  The concept of ADLs was originally proposed in the     s by Sidney Katz and his team at the Benjamin Rose Hospital in Cleveland  OH and has been added to and refined by a variety of researchers since that time  Health professionals often use a person s ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measurement of their functional status  particularly in regard to people post injury  with disabilities and the elderly  Younger children often require help from adults to perform ADLs  as they have not yet developed the skills necessary to perform them independently  ADLs are defined as  the things we normally do    such as feeding ourselves  bathing  dressing  grooming  work  homemaking  and leisure   A number of national surveys collect data on the ADL status of the U S  population  While basic definitions of ADLs have been suggested  what specifically constitutes a particular ADL for each individual may vary  Adaptive equipment and devices may be used to enhance and increase independence in performing ADLs AcupunctureAcupuncture is a form of alternative medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body  It is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine  TCM   TCM theory and practice are not based upon scientific knowledge  and acupuncture is a pseudoscience  There are a diverse range of acupuncture theories based on different philosophies  and techniques vary depending on the country  The method used in TCM is likely the most widespread in the US  It is most often used for pain relief  though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions  Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment  The conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent  An overview of Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions  and it suggests acupuncture may be effective only for chemotherapy induced nausea vomiting  postoperative nausea vomiting  and idiopathic headache  A systematic review of systematic reviews found little evidence of acupuncture s effectiveness in treating pain  The evidence suggests that short term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long term benefits  Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain  though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture s effects are mainly due to placebo  A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias  A meta analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost effective as an adjunct to standard care  while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain  Acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single use needles  When properly delivered  it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects  Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect of the practitioner  A review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade  The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections  Since serious adverse events continue to be reported  it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk  Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as qi  meridians  and acupuncture points  and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy  qi  flowing through meridians  which was a major part of early belief systems  Acupuncture is believed to have originated around     BC in China  around the time The Yellow Emperor s Classic of Internal Medicine  Huangdi Neijing  was published  though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier  Over time  conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar  celestial and earthly cycles  yin and yang energies  and a body s  rhythm  on the effectiveness of treatment  Acupuncture grew and diminished in popularity in China repeatedly  depending on the country s political leadership and the favor of rationalism or Western medicine  Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the  th century AD  then to Japan through medical missionaries  and then to Europe  starting with France  In the   th century  as it spread to the United States and Western countries  the spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflict with Western beliefs were abandoned in favor of tapping needles into nerves Acute careAcute care is a branch of secondary health care where a patient receives active but short term treatment for a severe injury or episode of illness  an urgent medical condition  or during recovery from surgery  In medical terms  care for acute health conditions is the opposite from chronic care  or longer term care  Acute care services are generally delivered by teams of health care professionals from a range of medical and surgical specialties  Acute care may require a stay in a hospital emergency department  ambulatory surgery center  urgent care centre or other short term stay facility  along with the assistance of diagnostic services  surgery  or follow up outpatient care in the community  Hospital based acute inpatient care typically has the goal of discharging patients as soon as they are deemed healthy and stable  Acute care settings include but are not limited to  emergency department  intensive care  coronary care  cardiology  neonatal intensive care  and many general areas where the patient could become acutely unwell and require stabilization and transfer to another higher dependency unit for further treatment Allied health professionsAllied health professions are health care professions distinct from nursing  medicine  and pharmacy  They work in health care teams to make the health care system function by providing a range of diagnostic  technical  therapeutic and direct patient care and support services that are critical to the other health professionals they work with and the patients they serve Alzheimer s diseaseAlzheimer s disease  AD   also referred to simply as Alzheimer s  is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time  It is the cause of     to     of cases of dementia  The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events  short term memory loss   As the disease advances  symptoms can include problems with language  disorientation  including easily getting lost   mood swings  loss of motivation  not managing self care  and behavioural issues  As a person s condition declines  they often withdraw from family and society  Gradually  bodily functions are lost  ultimately leading to death  Although the speed of progression can vary  the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years  The cause of Alzheimer s disease is poorly understood  About     of the risk is believed to be genetic with many genes usually involved  Other risk factors include a history of head injuries  depression  or hypertension  The disease process is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain  A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes  Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing  Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis  Mental and physical exercise  and avoiding obesity may decrease the risk of AD  There are no medications or supplements that decrease risk  No treatments stop or reverse its progression  though some may temporarily improve symptoms  Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance  often placing a burden on the caregiver  the pressures can include social  psychological  physical  and economic elements  Exercise programmes may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes  Treatment of behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common but not usually recommended due to there often being little benefit and an increased risk of early death  In       there were approximately    million people worldwide with AD  It most often begins in people over    years of age  although    to    of cases are early onset Alzheimer s which begin before this  It affects about    of people    years and older  In       dementia resulted in about         deaths  It was first described by  and later named after  German psychiatrist and pathologist Alois Alzheimer in       In developed countries  AD is one of the most financially costly diseases American Board of Physical Therapy SpecialtiesThe American Board of Physical Therapy

in      to represent the interests and concerns of occupational therapy practitioners and students and improve the quality of occupational therapy services  AOTA membership is approximately        occupational therapists  occupational therapy assistants  and students  The National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy was the founding name of the AOTA American Physical Therapy AssociationThe American Physical Therapy Association  APTA  is the official member organization of the profession in the United States American Speech Language Hearing AssociationThe American Speech Language Hearing Association  ASHA  is a professional association for speech language pathologists  audiologists  and speech  language  and hearing scientists in the United States and internationally  It has more than         members and affiliates  The mission of the American Speech Language Hearing Association is to promote the interests of and provide the highest quality services for professionals in audiology  speech language pathology  and speech and hearing science  and to advocate for people with communication disabilities  The association s national office is located at      Research Boulevard  Rockville  Maryland  The organization also has an office on Capitol Hill  Arlene Pietranton is currently serving as the association s executive director   AmputationAmputation is the removal of a limb by trauma  medical illness  or surgery  As a surgical measure  it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb  such as malignancy or gangrene  In some cases  it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such problems  A special case is that of congenital amputation  a congenital disorder  where fetal limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands  In some countries  amputation of the hands  feet or other body parts is or was used as a form of punishment for people who committed crimes  Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism  it may also occur as a war injury  In some cultures and religions  minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment  In the US  the majority of new amputations occur due to complications of the vascular system  the blood vessels   especially from diabetes  Between      and       there were an average of         hospital discharges for amputation per year in the US Amyotrophic lateral sclerosisAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS   also known as Lou Gehrig s disease and motor neurone disease  MND   is a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles  Some also use the term  motor neuron disease  for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common  ALS is characterized by stiff muscles  muscle twitching  and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size  This results in difficulty speaking  swallowing  and eventually breathing  The cause is not known in     to     of cases  About       of cases are inherited from a person s parents  About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes  The diagnosis is based on a person s signs and symptoms with testing done to rule out other potential causes  No cure for ALS is known  A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months  Non invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life  The disease usually starts around the age of    and in inherited cases around the age of     The average survival from onset to death is two to four years  About     survive longer than    years  Most die from respiratory failure  In much of the world  rates of ALS are unknown  In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two people per         per year  Descriptions of the disease date back to at least      by Charles Bell  In       the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean Martin Charcot  who in      began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  It became well known in the United States in the   th century when in      it affected the baseball player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide when physicist Stephen Hawking  diagnosed in      and expected to die within two years  became famous  In       videos of the ice bucket challenge went viral on the World Wide Web and increased public awareness of the condition Aquatic therapyAquatic therapy refers to treatments and exercises performed in water for relaxation  fitness  physical rehabilitation  and other therapeutic benefit  Typically a qualified aquatic therapist gives constant attendance to a person receiving treatment in a heated therapy pool  Aquatic therapy techniques include Ai Chi  Aqua Running  Bad Ragaz Ring Method  Burdenko Method  Halliwick  Watsu  and other aquatic bodywork forms  Therapeutic applications include neurological disorders  spine pain  musculoskeletal pain  postoperative orthopedic rehabilitation  pediatric disabilities  and pressure ulcers ArthritisArthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints  Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness  Other symptoms may include redness  warmth  swelling  and decreased range of motion of the affected joints  In some types other organs are also affected  Onset can be gradual or sudden  There are over     types of arthritis  The most common forms are osteoarthritis  degenerative joint disease  and rheumatoid arthritis  Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers  knees  and hips  Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet  Other types include gout  lupus  fibromyalgia  and septic arthritis  They are all types of rheumatic disease  Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat  Weight loss and exercise may also be useful  Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol  acetaminophen  may be used  In some a joint replacement may be useful  Osteoarthritis affects more than      of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about       of people  Gout affects about   to    of the Western population at some point in their lives  In Australia about     of people are affected  while in the United States more than     of have a type of arthritis  Overall the disease becomes more common with age  Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life  The term is from Greek arthro  meaning joint and  itis meaning inflammation Assistive technologyAssistive technology is an umbrella term that includes assistive  adaptive  and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities and also includes the process used in selecting  locating  and using them  Assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish  or had great difficulty accomplishing  by providing enhancements to  or changing methods of interacting with  the technology needed to accomplish such tasks Associate degreeAn associate degree is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting two years  It is considered to be greater level of education than a high school diploma or GED but less than a bachelor s degree  The first associate degrees were awarded in the U K   where they are no longer awarded  in      before spreading to the U S  in       They have since been introduced in a small number of other countries Athletic trainerAn athletic trainer is a certified and licensed health care professional who practices in the field of sports medicine  Athletic training has been recognized by the American Medical Association  AMA  as an allied health care profession since       As defined by the Strategic Implementation Team of the National Athletic Trainers  Association  NATA  in August         Athletic training is practiced by athletic trainers  health care professionals who collaborate with physicians to optimize activity and quality of life for patients both of the physically active and sedentary population  Athletic training encompasses the prevention  diagnosis and intervention of emergency  acute and chronic medical conditions involving impairment  functional limitations and disabilities    To become an athletic trainer one must have a degree from an accredited professional level education program and then sit for and pass the Board of Certification  BOC  examination  Each state then has their own regulatory agencies that control the practice of athletic training in their state  Most states      require an athletic trainer to obtain a license in order to practice in that state    states  Colorado  Hawaii  Minnesota  Oregon  West Virginia  require registration    states  New York  South Carolina  require certification  while California has no state regulations on the practice of athletic training  Areas of expertise of certified athletic trainers include  Apply protective or injury preventive devices such as tape  bandages  and braces Recognize and evaluate injuries Provide first aid or emergency care Develop and carry out rehabilitation programs for injured athletes Plan and implement comprehensive programs to prevent injury and illness among athletes Perform administrative tasks such as keeping records and writing reports on injuries and treatment programs  Services rendered by the athletic trainer take place in a wide variety of settings and venues  including actual athletic training facilities  primary schools  universities  inpatient and outpatient physical rehabilitation clinics  hospitals  physician offices  community centers  workplaces  and even the military  Emerging settings for athletic training include surgical fellowship opportunities Bachelor s degreeA bachelor s degree  from Middle Latin baccalaureus  or baccalaureate  from Modern Latin baccalaureatus  is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to seven years  depending on institution and academic discipline   In some institutions and educational systems  some bachelor s degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate degrees after a first degree has been completed  In countries with qualifications frameworks  bachelor s degrees are normally one of the major levels in the framework  sometimes two levels where non honours and honours bachelor s degrees are considered separately   although some qualifications titled bachelor s degrees may be at other levels  e g  MBBS  and some qualifications with non bachelor s titles may be classified as bachelor s degrees  e g  the Scottish MA and Canadian MD   The term bachelor in the   th century referred to a knight bachelor  who was too young or poor to gather vassals under his own banner  By the end of the   th century  it was also used by junior members of guilds or universities  By folk etymology or wordplay  the word baccalaureus came to be associated with bacca lauri   laurel berry   in reference to laurels being awarded for academic success or honours  Under the British system  and those influenced by it  undergraduate academic degrees are differentiated as either non honours degrees  known variously as pass degrees  ordinary degrees or general degrees  or honours degrees  the latter sometimes denoted by the addition of   Hons   after the degree abbreviation  An honours degree generally requires a higher academic standard than a pass degree  and in some systems an additional year of study beyond the non honours bachelor s  In some countries  e g  Australia  there is a  postgraduate  bachelor s honours degree  which may be taken as a consecutive academic degree  continuing on from the completion of a bachelor s degree program in the same field  or  in a similar manner to the UK system  as part of an integrated honours program Balance  ability In biomechanics  balance is an ability to maintain the line of gravity  vertical line from centre of mass  of a body within the base of support with minimal postural sway  Sway is the horizontal movement of the centre of gravity even when a person is standing still  A certain amount of sway is essential and inevitable due to small perturbations within the body  e g   breathing  shifting body weight from one foot to the other or from forefoot to rearfoot  or from external triggers  e g   visual distortions  floor translations   An increase in sway is not necessarily an indicator of dysfunctional balance so much as it is an indicator of decreased sensorimotor control  Maintaining balance requires coordination of input from multiple sensory systems including the vestibular  somatosensory  and visual systems  Vestibular system  sense organs that regulate equilibrium  equilibrioception   directional information as it relates to head position  internal gravitational  linear  and angular acceleration  Somatosensory system  senses of proprioception and kinesthesia of joints  information from skin and joints  pressure and vibratory senses   spatial position and movement relative to the support surface  movement and position of different body parts relative to each other Visual system  Reference to verticality of body and head motion  spatial location relative to objects The senses must detect changes of spatial orientation with respect to the base of support  regardless of whether the body moves or the base is altered  There are environmental factors that can affect balance such as light conditions  floor surface changes  alcohol  drugs  and ear infection  There are balance impairments associated with aging  Age related decline in the ability of the above systems to receive and integrate sensory information contributes to poor balance in older adults  As a result  the elderly are at an increased risk of falls  In fact  one in three adults aged    and over will fall each year  In the case of an individual standing quietly upright  the limit of stability is defined as the amount of postural sway at which balance is lost and corrective action is required  Body sway can occur in all planes of motion  which make it an increasingly difficult ability to rehabilitate  There is strong evidence in research showing that deficits in postural balance is related to the control of medial lateral stability and an increased risk of falling  To remain balanced  a person standing must be able to keep the vertical projection of their center of mass within their base of support  resulting in little medial lateral or anterior posterior sway  Ankle sprains are one of the most frequently occurring injuries among athletes and physically active people  The most common residual disability post ankle sprain is instability along with body sway  Mechanical instability includes insufficient stabilizing structures and mobility that exceed the physiological limits Functional instability involves recurrent sprains or a feeling of giving way of the ankle  It is found that nearly     of patients with ankle sprains suffer from instability and an increase in body sway  Injury to the ankle causes a proprioceptive deficit and impaired postural control  Individuals with muscular weakness  occult instability  and decreased postural control are more susceptible to ankle injury than those with better postural control  Balance can be severely affected in individuals with neurological conditions  Patients who suffer a stroke or a spinal cord injury for example  can struggle with this ability  It has also been determined that impaired balance is strongly associated with future function and recovery in some cases  particularly in stroke patients  Additionally  balance problems have been identified as the strongest predictor of falls  Another population where balance is severely affected is Parkinson s disease patients  A study done by Nardone and Schieppati        showed that individuals with Parkinson s disease problems in balance have been related to a reduced limit of stability and an impaired production of anticipatory motor strategies and abnormal calibration  Balance can also be negatively affected in a normal population through fatigue in the musculature surrounding the ankles  knees  and hips  Studies have found  however  that muscle fatigue around the hips  gluteals and lumbar extensors  and knees have a greater effect on postural stability  sway   It is thought that muscle fatigue leads to a decreased ability to contract with the correct amount of force or accuracy  As a result  proprioception and kinesthetic feedback from joints are altered so that conscious joint awareness may be negatively effected Bureau of Labor StatisticsThe Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  is a unit of the United States Department of Labor  It is the principal fact finding agency for the U S  government in the broad field of labor economics and statistics and serves as a principal agency of the U S  Federal Statistical System  The BLS is a governmental statistical agency that collects  processes  analyzes  and disseminates essential statistical data to the American public  the U S  Congress  other Federal agencies  State and local governments  business  and labor representatives  The BLS also serves as a statistical resource to the Department of Labor  and conducts research into how much families need to earn to be able to enjoy a decent standard of living  The BLS data must satisfy a number of criteria  including relevance to current social and economic issues  timeliness in reflecting today s rapidly changing economic conditions  accuracy and consistently high statistical quality  impartiality in both subject matter and presentation  and accessibility to all  To avoid the appearance of partiality  the dates of major data releases are scheduled more than a year in advance  in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget CancerCancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body  Not all tumors are cancerous  benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body  Possible signs and symptoms include a lump  abnormal bleeding  prolonged cough  unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements  While these symptoms may indicate cancer  they may have other causes  Over     types of cancers affect humans  Tobacco use is the cause of about     of cancer deaths  Another     is due to obesity  poor diet  lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol  Other factors include certain infections  exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants  In the developing world nearly     of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B  hepatitis C and human papillomavirus  HPV   These factors act  at least partly  by changing the genes of a cell  Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops  Approximately       of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person s parents  Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests  It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy  Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking  maintaining a healthy weight  not drinking too much alcohol  eating plenty of vegetables  fruits and whole grains  vaccination against certain infectious diseases  not eating too much processed and red meat  and avoiding too much sunlight exposure  Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer  The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial  Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy  surgery  chemotherapy  and targeted therapy  Pain and symptom management are an important part of care  Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease  The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment  In children under    at diagnosis the five year survival rate in the developed world is on average      For cancer in the United States the average five year survival rate is      In      about      million new cases of cancer occurred globally  not including skin cancer other than melanoma   It caused about     million deaths or       of human deaths  The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer  prostate cancer  colorectal cancer and stomach cancer  In females  the most common types are breast cancer  colorectal cancer  lung cancer and cervical cancer  If skin cancer other than melanoma were included in total new cancers each year it would account for around     of cases  In children  acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and brain tumors are most common except in Africa where non Hodgkin lymphoma occurs more often  In       about         children under    years of age were diagnosed with cancer  The risk of cancer increases significantly with age and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries  Rates are increasing as more people live to an old age and as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world  The financial costs of cancer were estimated at       trillion US dollars per year as of      Cardiopulmonary resuscitationCardiopulmonary resuscitation  commonly known as CPR  is an emergency procedure that combines chest compression often with artificial ventilation in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest  It is indicated in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing  for example  agonal respirations  According to the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation guidelines  CPR involves chest compressions for adults between   cm      in  and   cm      in  deep and at a rate of at least     to     per minute  The rescuer may also provide artificial ventilation by either exhaling air into the subject s mouth or nose  mouth to mouth resuscitation  or using a device that pushes air into the subject s lungs  mechanical ventilation   Current recommendations place emphasis on high quality chest compressions over artificial ventilation  a simplified CPR method involving chest compressions only is recommended for untrained rescuers  In children only doing compressions may result in worse outcomes  CPR alone is unlikely to restart the heart  Its main purpose is to restore partial flow of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart  The objective is to delay tissue death and to extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage  Administration of an electric shock to the subject s heart  termed defibrillation  is usually needed in order to restore a viable or  perfusing  heart rhythm  Defibrillation is effective only for certain heart rhythms  namely ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia  rather than asystole or pulseless electrical activity  CPR may succeed in inducing a heart rhythm that may be shockable  In general  CPR is continued until the person has a return of spontaneous circulation  ROSC  or is declared dead Circulatory systemThe circulatory system  also called the cardiovascular system or the vascular system  is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients  such as amino acids and electrolytes   oxygen  carbon dioxide  hormones  and blood cells to and from the cells in the body to provide nourishment and help in fighting diseases  stabilize temperature and pH  and maintain homeostasis  The study of the blood flow is called hemodynamics  The study of the properties of the blood flow is called hemorheology  The circulatory system is often seen to comprise two separate systems  the cardiovascular system  which distributes blood  and the lymphatic system  which circulates lymph  The passage of lymph for example takes much longer than that of blood  Blood is a fluid consisting of plasma  red blood cells  white blood cells  and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system  carrying oxygen and nutrients to and waste materials away from all body tissues  Lymph is essentially recycled excess blood plasma after it has been filtered from the interstitial fluid  between cells  and returned to the lymphatic system  The cardiovascular  from Latin words meaning  heart  and  vessel   system comprises the blood  heart  and blood vessels  The lymph  lymph nodes  and lymph vessels form the lymphatic system  which returns filtered blood plasma from the interstitial fluid  between cells  as lymph  While humans  as well as other vertebrates  have a closed cardiovascular system  meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries  veins and capillaries   some invertebrate groups have an open cardiovascular system  The lymphatic system  on the other hand  is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood  The more primitive  diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems Cerebral palsyCerebral palsy  CP  is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood  Signs and symptoms vary among people  Often  symptoms include poor coordination  stiff muscles  weak muscles  and tremors  There may be problems with sensation  vision  hearing  swallowing  and speaking  Often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over  sit  crawl  or walk as early as other children of their age  Difficulty with the ability to think or reason and seizures each occurs in about one third of people with CP  While the symptoms may get more noticeable over the first few years of life  the underlying problems do not worsen over time  Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement  balance  and posture  Most often the problems occur during pregnancy  however  they may also occur during childbirth  or shortly after birth  Often the cause is unknown  Risk factors include preterm birth  being a twin  certain infections during pregnancy such as toxoplasmosis or rubella  exposure to methylmercury during pregnancy  a difficult delivery  and head trauma during the first few years of life  among others  About    of cases are believed to be due to an inherited genetic cause  A number of sub types are classified based on the specific problems present  For example  those with stiff muscles have spastic cerebral palsy  those with poor coordination have ataxic cerebral palsy  and those with writhing movements have athetoid cerebral palsy  Diagnosis is based on the child s development over time  Blood tests and medical imaging may be used to rule out other possible causes  CP is partly preventable through immunization of the mother and efforts to prevent head injuries in children such as through improved safety  There is no cure for CP  however  supportive treatments  medications  and surgery may help many individuals  This may include physical therapy  occupational therapy  and speech therapy  Medications such as diazepam  baclofen  and botulinum toxin may help relax stiff muscles  Surgery may include lengthening muscles and cutting overly active nerves  Often external braces and other assistive technology are helpful  Some affected children can achieve near normal adult lives with appropriate treatment  While alternative medicines are frequently used there is no evidence to support their use  CP is the most common movement disorder in children  It occurs in about     per       live births  Cerebral palsy has been documented throughout history with the first known descriptions occurring in the work of Hippocrates in the  th century BCE  Extensive study of the condition began in the   th century by William John Little  after whom spastic diplegia was called  Little disease   William Osler first named it  cerebral palsy  from the German  zerebrale Kinderl hmung   cerebral child paralysis   A number of potential treatments are being examined  including stem cell therapy  However  more research is required to determine if it is effective and safe Charcot Marie Tooth diseaseCharcot Marie Tooth disease  CMT  is one of the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies  a group of varied inherited disorders of the peripheral nervous system characterised by progressive loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation across various parts of the body  Currently incurable  this disease is the most commonly inherited neurological disorder  and affects approximately   in       people  CMT was previously classified as a subtype of muscular dystrophy Chartered Society of PhysiotherapyThe Chartered Society of Physiotherapy  CSP  is the professional body and trade union for physiotherapists in the United Kingdom  Founded in       the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy has grown to become the profession s largest membership organisation with more than        members  Queen Mary was royal patron from      until her death in       when Queen Elizabeth II became royal patron ChiropracticChiropractic is a form of alternative medicine concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of unverified mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system  especially the spine  Proponents believe that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system  The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy  especially spinal manipulation therapy  SMT   manipulations of other joints and soft tissues  Its foundation is at odds with mainstream medicine  and chiropractic is sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation and  innate intelligence   Multiple systematic reviews have found no evidence that chiropractic manipulation is effective  with the possible exception of treatment for lower back pain  A critical evaluation found that collectively  spinal manipulation was ineffective at treating any condition  There is not sufficient data to establish the safety of chiropractic manipulations  The rate of adverse events is unknown as they are under reported  Chiropractic is frequently associated with mild to moderate adverse effects  The incidence of serious complications which can lead to permanent disability or death is probably rare  There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of stroke and death from cervical manipulation  Several deaths have been associated with this technique and it is suggested that the relationship is causative  a claim which is disputed by many chiropractors  Chiropractic is widely established in the United States  Canada  and Australia  It has had a strong political base and sustained demand for services  in recent decades gaining increased acceptance among conventional physicians and health plans in the U S   and evidence based medicine has been used to review research studies and generate practice guidelines  Most who seek chiropractic care do so for low back pain  and back and neck pain are considered the specialties of chiropractic  but many chiropractors treat ailments other than musculoskeletal issues  Many chiropractors describe themselves as primary care providers  despite chiropractic clinical training not supporting the requirements to perform such care  with their role in primary care being limited and disputed  Attitudes towards mainstream medicine vary among chiropractors  who often offer conventional treatments such as physical therapy and lifestyle counseling as well  and it may be difficult for the lay person to distinguish the unscientific from the scientific  D  D  Palmer founded chiropractic in the     s  after allegedly receiving it from  the other world   and his son B  J  Palmer helped to expand it in the early   th century  Throughout its history  chiropractic has been controversial Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseChronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD  is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long term poor airflow  The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production  COPD is a progressive disease  meaning it typically worsens over time  Eventually everyday activities  such as walking up stairs  become difficult  Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD  The term  chronic bronchitis  is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years  Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD  with factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role  In the developing world  one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires  Long term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs  resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue  The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests  In contrast to asthma  the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator  Most cases of COPD can be prevented by reducing exposure to risk factors  This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality  While treatment can slow worsening  there is no cure  COPD treatments include stopping smoking  vaccinations  respiratory rehabilitation  and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids  Some people may benefit from long term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation  In those who have periods of acute worsening  increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed  As of      COPD affects     million people or nearly   percent of the global population  It typically occurs in people over the age of     Males and females are affected equally commonly  In      it resulted in     million deaths  up from     million deaths in       More than     of these deaths occur in the developing world  The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of higher smoking rates in the developing world  and an aging population in many countries  It resulted in an estimated economic cost of      trillion in      Clinical electrophysiologyClinical electrophysiology is the application of electrophysiology principles to medicine  The two main branches of this discipline are electrotherapy and electrophysiologic testing  EEG  electromyography  etc   Clinical electrophysiology can be utilized in the study and treatment of various physiological conditions  and most notably in clinical cardiac electrophysiology College education in QuebecCollege education  informally referred to as College and often informally by the umbrella acronym CEGEP in the Canadian province of Quebec is the post secondary level immediately after high school but required for university admissions  The Quebec education system is unique in North America  One aspect of that uniqueness is that it is the only system that has four separate education levels  grade school  high school  college  university  The college level is a separate and distinct step in Quebec  For students graduating from high school in Quebec a college diploma is required for admission into university  In the rest of Canada colleges have historically been technical schools that offer specialized professional or vocational education in specific employment fields  In the USA the term college is synonymous with university Coll ge MontmorencyFounded on November          Coll ge Montmorency is a Francophone public college in Chomedey  Laval  Quebec  Canada  near the Montmorency Metro station  As of       there were between      and      students enrolled Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy EducationThe Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education  CAPTE  is the agency recognized by the United States Department of Education for granting accreditation status to entry level education programs for Physical Therapists and Physical Therapist Assistants  The stated mission of CAPTE includes  establishing and applying standards that assure quality and continuous improvement in the entry level preparation of physical therapists and physical therapist assistants and that reflect the evolving nature of education  research  and practice   As of    December        CAPTE recognizes     educational institutions supporting     accredited programs for PTs and     institutions supporting     accredited programs for PTAs Coronary artery bypass surgeryCoronary artery bypass surgery  also known as coronary artery bypass graft  CABG  pronounced  cabbage   surgery  and colloquially heart bypass or bypass surgery  is a surgical procedure to restore normal blood flow to an obstructed coronary artery  There are two main approaches  In one  the left internal thoracic artery  internal mammary artery  is diverted to the left anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery  In the other  a great saphenous vein is removed from a leg  one end is attached to the aorta or one of its major branches  and the other end is attached to the obstructed artery immediately after the obstruction to restore blood flow  It is performed to relieve angina unsatisfactorily controlled by maximum tolerated anti ischemic medication  prevent or relieve left ventricular dysfunction  and or reduce the risk of death  It does not prevent heart attacks  This surgery is usually performed with the heart stopped  necessitating the usage of cardiopulmonary bypass  however  two alternative techniques are also available allowing CABG to be performed on a beating heart either without using the cardiopulmonary bypass deemed as  off pump  surgery or performing beating surgery using partial assistance of the cardiopulmonary bypass called as  on pump beating  surgery  The latter gathers the advantages of the on pump stopped and off pump while minimizing their respective side effects  This surgery is often indicated when coronary arteries have a     to     obstruction  The obstruction being bypassed is typically due to arteriosclerosis  atherosclerosis  or both  Arteriosclerosis is characterized by thickening  loss of elasticity  and calcification of the arterial wall  most often resulting in a generalized narrowing in the affected coronary artery  Atherosclerosis is characterized by yellowish plaques of cholesterol  lipids  and cellular debris deposited into the inner layer of the wall of a large or medium sized coronary artery  most often resulting in a focal partial obstruction in the affected artery  Each can limit blood flow if it causes a cross sectional narrowing of at least     Intensive care medicineIntensive care medicine or critical care medicine is a branch of medicine concerned with the diagnosis and management of life threatening conditions requiring sophisticated organ support and invasive monitoring CryotherapyCryotherapy is the local or general use of low temperatures in medical therapy  Cryotherapy is used to treat a variety of benign and malignant tissue damage  medically called lesions  The term  cryotherapy  comes from the Greek cryo        meaning cold  and therapy            meaning cure  Cryotherapy has been used as early as the seventeenth century  Its goal is to decrease cell growth and reproduction  cellular metabolism   increase cellular survival  decrease inflammation  decrease pain and spasm  promote the constriction of blood vessels  vasoconstriction   and when using extreme temperatures  to destroy cells by crystallizing the cytosol  which is the liquid found inside cells  also known as intracellular fluid  ICF   The most prominent use of the term refers to the surgical treatment  specifically known as cryosurgery  Other therapies that use the term are whole body cryotherapy and ice pack therapy Cystic fibrosisCystic fibrosis  CF  is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs  but also the pancreas  liver  kidneys  and intestine  Long term issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections  Other signs and symptoms may include sinus infections  poor growth  fatty stool  clubbing of the fingers and toes  and infertility in males  Different people may have different degrees of symptoms  CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner  It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  CFTR  protein  Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly normal  CFTR is involved in production of sweat  digestive fluids  and mucus  When CFTR is not functional  secretions which are usually thin instead become thick  The condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing  Screening of infants at birth takes place in some areas of the world  No cure for cystic fibrosis is known  Lung infections are treated with antibiotics which may be given intravenously  inhaled  or by mouth  Sometimes  the antibiotic azithromycin is used long term  Inhaled hypertonic saline and salbutamol may also be useful  Lung transplantation may be an option if lung function continues to worsen  Pancreatic enzyme replacement and fat soluble vitamin supplementation are important  especially in the young  Airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy have some short term benefit  but long term effects are unclear  The average life expectancy is between    and    years in the developed world  Lung problems are responsible for death in     of people with cystic fibrosis  CF is most common among people of Northern European ancestry and affects about one out of every       newborns  About one in    people is a carrier  It is least common in Africans and Asians  It was first recognized as a specific disease by Dorothy Andersen in       with descriptions that fit the condition occurring at least as far back as       The name  cystic fibrosis  refers to the characteristic fibrosis and cysts that form within the pancreas C gep Marie VictorinThe C gep Marie Victorin is a French public college in Montreal  Quebec   Canada  It is located at       rue Marie Victorin in the borough of Montr al Nord  C gep is an acronym for Coll ge d enseignement g n ral et professionnel  generally translated into English as vocational college Dawson CollegeDawson College is an English language Coll ge d enseignement g n ral et professionnel  CEGEP  located in Montreal  Quebec  Canada  It is situated near the heart of downtown Montreal in a former nunnery on approximately    acres of green space  It is the largest CEGEP in the province of Quebec  with a student population of approximately       day students and       evening students enrolled in more than    fields of study DebridementDebridement  d  bri dm nt  is the medical removal of dead  damaged  or infected tissue to improve the healing potential of the remaining healthy tissue  Removal may be surgical  mechanical  chemical  autolytic  self digestion   and by maggot therapy  where certain species of live maggots selectively eat only necrotic tissue  In oral hygiene and dentistry  debridement refers to the removal of plaque and calculus that have accumulated on the teeth  Debridement in this case may be performed using ultrasonic instruments  which fracture the calculus  thereby facilitating its removal  as well as hand tools  including periodontal scaler and curettes  or through the use of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide  In podiatry practitioners such as chiropodists  podiatrists and foot health practitioners remove conditions such as calluses and verrucas  Debridement is an important part of the healing process for burns and other serious wounds  it is also used for treating some kinds of snake and spider bites  Sometimes the boundaries of the problem tissue may not be clearly defined  For example  when excising a tumor  there may be micrometastases along the edges of the tumor that are too small to be detected  and if not removed  could cause a relapse  In such circumstances  a surgeon may opt to debride a portion of the surrounding healthy tissue   as little as possible   to ensure that the tumor is completely removed DiathermyDiathermy is electrically induced heat or the use of high frequency electromagnetic currents as a form of physical or occupational therapy and in surgical procedures  The field was pioneered in      by German physician Karl Franz Nagelschmidt  who coined the term diathermy from the Greek words dia and       therma  literally meaning  heating through   adj   diather mal  diather mic   Diathermy is commonly used for muscle relaxation  and to induce deep heating in tissue for therapeutic purposes in medicine  It is used in physical therapy and occupational therapy to deliver moderate heat directly to pathologic lesions in the deeper tissues of the body  Diathermy is produced by three techniques  ultrasound  ultrasonic diathermy   short wave radio frequencies in the range       MHz  shortwave diathermy  or microwaves typically in the     MHz or      GHz bands  microwave diathermy   the methods differing mainly in their penetration capability  It exerts physical effects and elicits a spectrum of physiological responses  The same techniques are also used to create higher tissue temperatures to destroy neoplasms  cancer and tumors   warts  and infected tissues  this is called hyperthermia treatment  In surgery diathermy is used to cauterize blood vessels to prevent excessive bleeding  The technique is particularly valuable in neurosurgery and surgery of the eye Digital object identifierIn computing  a Digital Object Identifier or DOI is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify objects  standardized by the ISO  An implementation of the Handle System  DOIs are in wide use mainly to identify academic  professional  and government information  such as journal articles  research reports and data sets  and official publications though they also have been used to identify other types of information resources  such as commercial videos  A DOI aims to be  resolvable   usually to some form of access to the information object to which the DOI refers  This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object  such as a URL  indicating where the object can be found  Thus  by being actionable and interoperable  a DOI differs from identifiers such as ISBNs and ISRCs which aim only to uniquely identify their referents  The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model for representing metadata  The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document  whereas its location and other metadata may change  Referring to an online document by its DOI provides more stable linking than simply using its URL  because if its URL changes  the publisher only needs to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL  The developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation  IDF   which introduced it in       Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs  The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF  By late April      more than    million DOI names had been assigned by some       organizations  and by April      this number had grown to    million DOI names assigned through       organizations Quebec Diploma of College StudiesA College Diploma in Quebec for pre university studies and technical studies   officially titled  Diploma of College Studies  often abbreviated DCS  French  Dipl me d  tudes coll giales or DEC  is a degree issued by the Ministry of Education  Recreation and Sports after a student has successfully completed an approved college education program  The Quebec education system is slightly different from the rest of North America  One aspect of its distinctness is that it is the only system that requires a college degree before entering university  The college diploma was established at the same time as the current college system  There are two types of college diplomas  a two year pre university diploma or a three year vocational training diploma  A Diploma of College Studies is a university prerequisite for Quebec high school graduates  unless applying as a mature student  A pre university Diploma of College Studies is roughly equivalent in the rest of North America to a combination of grade twelve and the first year of an Associate s degree  while a three year vocational is often equivalent to an Associate s  The professional diploma equivalent to the DEC is the Attestation of College Studies  AEC  Attestation d  tudes coll giales   whereas the DEC is for non trade studeis DisabilityDisability is an impairment that may be cognitive  developmental  intellectual  mental  physical  sensory  or some combination of these  It substantially affects a person s life activities and may be present from birth or occur during a person s lifetime   Disabilities is an umbrella term  covering impairments  activity limitations  and participation restrictions  An impairment is a problem in body function or structure  an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action  while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations  Disability is thus not just a health problem  It is a complex phenomenon  reflecting the interaction between features of a person s body and features of the society in which he or she lives   Disability is a contested concept  with different meanings for different communities  It may be used to refer to physical or mental attributes that some institutions  particularly medicine  view as needing to be fixed  the medical model   It may refer to limitations imposed on people by the constraints of an ableist society  the social model   Or the term may serve to refer to the identity of people with disabilities  The discussion over disability s definition arose out of disability activism in the U S  and U K  in the     s  which challenged how the medical concept of disability dominated perception and discourse about disabilities  Debates about proper terminology and their implied politics continue in disability communities and the academic field of disability studies  In some countries  the law requires that disabilities are documented by a healthcare provider in order to assess qualifications for disability benefits Star SportsStar Sports is a group of Indian sports channels owned by Star India a subsidiary of   st Century Fox division STAR TV Doctor  title Doctor is an academic title that originates from the Latin word of the same spelling and meaning  The word is originally an agentive noun of the Latin verb doc re  d  ke r    to teach   It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the   th century  when the first doctorates were awarded at the University of Bologna and the University of Paris  This use spread around the world with European universities  Contracted  Dr  or  Dr    it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a research doctorate  e g  Ph D    In many parts of the world it is also used by medical practitioners  regardless of whether or not they hold a doctoral level degree Doctor of Physical TherapyA Doctor of Physical Therapy  DPT  degree is a post baccalaureate     year degree which may be conferred upon successful completion of a professional doctoral program  A Transitional Doctor of Physical Therapy Degree is also offered for those who already hold a professional Bachelor or Master of Physical Therapy  PT or MPT  degree  As of       all accredited and developing physical therapist programs are DPT programs  The DPT degree currently prepares students to be eligible for the PT license examination in all    states  As of March       there are     accredited Doctor of Physical Therapy programs in the United States  After completing a DPT program the doctor of physical therapy may continue training in a residency and then fellowship  As of December       there are     credentialed physical therapy residencies and    fellowships in the US  with    additional developing residencies and fellowships  Credentialed residencies are between   and    months while credentialed fellowships are between   and    months  In      the American Physical Therapy Association  APTA  passed its Vision      statement  which states  in part    By       physical therapy will be provided by physical therapists who are doctors of physical therapy  recognized by consumers and other health care professionals as the practitioners of choice to whom consumers have direct access for the diagnosis of  interventions for  and prevention of impairments  functional limitations  and disabilities related to movement  function  and health   As this statement highlights  the DPT program is an integral part of the APTA s continued advocacy for legislation granting consumers  i e  patients and clients  direct access to physical therapists  rather than requiring physician referral  Direct access is said to decrease wait times for access to care and even help reduce both cost to consumer and overall healthcare costs  As of January          all    states and the District of Columbia currently allow some form of direct access to physical therapists Dry needlingDry needling  also known as myofascial trigger point dry needling  is the use of either solid filiform needles  also referred to as acupuncture needles  or hollow core hypodermic needles for therapy of muscle pain  including pain related to myofascial pain syndrome  Dry needling is sometimes also known as intramuscular stimulation  IMS   Acupuncture is a broad category of needling practices with solid filiform needles  Modern acupuncture notably includes both traditional and Western medical acupuncture  dry needling is arguably one subcategory of western medical acupuncture  Chinese style tendinomuscular acupuncture relies on careful palpation of what are called  Ah Shi  points  which often correspond to both trigger points and or motor points in the myofascial tissue  Chinese style tendinomuscular acupuncture tends to use lower gauge  thicker  needles necessary for puncturing contraction knots with a high degree of precision  On the other hand  lighter styles of acupuncture  such as Japanese style  and many American styles  may tend towards very shallow insertions of higher gauge  thinner  needles  Most acupuncture styles  especially those with lighter techniques  require a detailed knowledge  not only of anatomy but also of the channel networks and connections  Thus  while some forms of acupuncture are not at all the same as dry needling  the term dry needling can refer quite specifically to what is now called Myofascial Acupuncture  Tendinomuscular Acupuncture  or some version of Sports Acupuncture Eccentric trainingAn eccentric contraction is the motion of an active muscle while it is lengthening under load  Eccentric training is repetitively doing eccentric muscle contractions  For example  in a biceps curl the action of lowering the dumbbell back down from the lift is the eccentric phase of that exercise   as long as the dumbbell is lowered slowly rather than letting it drop  i e   the biceps are in a state of contraction to control the rate of descent of the dumbbell   An eccentric contraction is one of the three distinct phases in the movement of muscles and tendons  the other two are an isometric contraction  no movement   and a concentric contraction  contracting   Eccentric training focuses on slowing down the elongation of the muscle process in order to challenge the muscles  which can lead to stronger muscles  faster muscle repair and increasing metabolic rate  Eccentric movement provides a braking mechanism for muscle and tendon groups that are experiencing concentric movement to protect joints from damage as the contraction is released  Eccentric training is particularly good for casual and high performance athletes or the elderly and patients looking to rehabilitate certain muscles and tendons ElbowIn primates  including humans  the elbow joint is the synovial hinge joint between the humerus in the upper arm and the radius and ulna in the forearm which allows the hand to be moved towards and away from the body  The superior radioulnar joint shares joint capsule with the elbow joint but plays no functional role at the elbow  The elbow region includes prominent landmarks such as the olecranon  the bony prominence at the very tip of the elbow   the elbow pit  and the lateral and medial epicondyles  The name for the elbow in Latin is cubitus  and so the word cubital is used in some elbow related terms  as in cubital nodes for example Electrical muscle stimulationElectrical muscle stimulation  EMS   also known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation  NMES  or electromyostimulation  is the elicitation of muscle contraction using electric impulses  EMS has received increasing attention in the last few years because of its potential to serve as a strength training tool for healthy subjects and athletes  a rehabilitation and preventive tool for partially or totally immobilized patients  a testing tool for evaluating the neural and or muscular function in vivo  and a post exercise recovery tool for athletes  The impulses are generated by a device and delivered through electrodes on the skin in direct proximity to the muscles to be stimulated  The impulses mimic the action potential coming from the central nervous system  causing the muscles to contract  The electrodes are generally pads that adhere to the skin  The use of EMS has been cited by sports scientists as a complementary technique for sports training and published research is available on the results obtained  In the United States  EMS devices are regulated by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA    A number of reviews have looked at the devices   ElectromyographyElectromyography  EMG  is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles  EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram  An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated  The signals can be analyzed to detect medical abnormalities  activation level  or recruitment order  or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement ElectromyographyElectromyography  EMG  is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the

or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement ElectrotherapyElectrotherapy is the use of electrical energy as a medical treatment  In medicine  the term electrotherapy can apply to a variety of treatments  including the use of electrical devices such as deep brain stimulators for neurological disease  The term has also been applied specifically to the use of electric current to speed wound healing  Additionally  the term  electrotherapy  or  electromagnetic therapy  has also been applied to a range of alternative medical devices and treatments  It has not been found to be effective in increasing bone healing European CommissionThe European Commission  EC  is an institution of the European Union  responsible for proposing legislation  implementing decisions  upholding the EU treaties and managing the day to day business of the EU  Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg  pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate  The Commission operates as a cabinet government  with    members of the Commission  informally known as  commissioners    There is one member per member state  but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state  One of the    is the Commission President  currently Jean Claude Juncker  proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament  The Council of the European Union then nominates the other    members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President  and the    members as a single body are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament  The current Commission is the Juncker Commission  which took office in late       The term Commission is used either in the narrow sense of the    member College of Commissioners  or College  or to also include the administrative body of about        European civil servants who are split into departments called directorates general and services  The procedural languages of the Commission are English  French and German  The Members of the Commission and their  cabinets   immediate teams  are based in the Berlaymont building in Brussels Evidence based practiceEvidence based practice  EBP  is an interdisciplinary approach to clinical practice that has been gaining ground following its formal introduction in       It started in medicine as evidence based medicine  EBM  and spread to other fields such as audiology  speech language pathology  dentistry  nursing  child life specialty  psychology  social work  education  library and information science  EBP is traditionally defined in terms of a  three legged stool  integrating three basic principles      the best available research evidence bearing on whether and why a treatment works      clinical expertise  clinical judgment and experience  to rapidly identify each patient s unique health state and diagnosis  their individual risks and benefits of potential interventions  and     client preferences and values  Evidence based behavioral practice  EBBP   entails making decisions about how to promote health or provide care by integrating the best available evidence with practitioner expertise and other resources  and with the characteristics  state  needs  values and preferences of those who will be affected  This is done in a manner that is compatible with the environmental and organizational context  Evidence is research findings derived from the systematic collection of data through observation and experiment and the formulation of questions and testing of hypotheses   Empirically supported treatments  ESTs  in some clinical psychology settings are defined as  clearly specified psychological treatments shown to be efficacious in controlled research with a delineated population Physical exercisePhysical exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness  It is performed for various reasons  including increasing growth and development  preventing aging  strengthening muscles and the cardiovascular system  honing athletic skills  weight loss or maintenance  and also enjoyment  Frequent and regular physical exercise boosts the immune system and helps prevent  diseases of affluence  such as cardiovascular disease  type   diabetes  and obesity  It may also help prevent stress and depression  increase quality of sleep and act as a non pharmaceutical sleep aid to treat diseases such as insomnia  help promote or maintain positive self esteem  improve mental health  maintain steady digestion and treat constipation and gas  regulate fertility health  and augment an individual s sex appeal or body image  which has been found to be linked with higher levels of self esteem  Childhood obesity is a growing global concern  and physical exercise may help decrease some of the effects of childhood and adult obesity  Some care providers call exercise the  miracle  or  wonder  drug alluding to the wide variety of benefits that it can provide for many individuals  Aside from the health advantages  these benefits may include different social rewards for staying active while enjoying the environment of one s culture  Many individuals choose to exercise publicly outdoors where they can congregate in groups  socialize  and appreciate life  In the United Kingdom two to four hours of light activity are recommended during working hours  This includes walking and standing  In the United States  the CDC ACSM consensus statement and the Surgeon General s report states that every adult should participate in moderate exercise  such as walking  swimming  and household tasks  for a minimum of    minutes daily Exercise physiologyExercise physiology is the physiology of physical exercise  It is the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to a wide range of exercise conditions  Exercise physiologists study the effect of exercise on pathology  and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression Exercise physiologyExercise physiology is the physiology of physical exercise  It is the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to a wide range of exercise conditions  Exercise physiologists study the effect of exercise on pathology  and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression Facial nerve paralysisFacial nerve paralysis is a common problem that involves the paralysis of any structures innervated by the facial nerve  The pathway of the facial nerve is long and relatively convoluted  and so there are a number of causes that may result in facial nerve paralysis  The most common is Bell s palsy  an idiopathic disease that may only be diagnosed by exclusion Physical therapy practice actA physical therapy practice act is a statute defining the scope and practice of physical therapy within the jurisdiction  outlining licensing requirements for Physical Therapists and Physical Therapist Assistants  and establishing penalties for violations of the law  In the United States  each state enacts its own practice act  resulting in some variation among the states  though the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy  FSBPT  has drafted a model definition in order to limit this variation Fine motor skillFine motor skill  or dexterity  is the coordination of small muscles  in movements usually involving the synchronization of hands and fingers with the eyes  The complex levels of manual dexterity that humans exhibit can be attributed to and demonstrated in tasks controlled by the nervous system  Fine motor skills aid in the growth of intelligence and develop continuously throughout the stages of human development StiffnessStiffness is the rigidity of an object   the extent to which it resists deformation in response to an applied force  The complementary concept is flexibility or pliability  the more flexible an object is  the less stiff it is Frenkel exercisesFrenkel exercises are a set of exercises developed by Professor Heinrich Sebastian Frenkel to treat ataxia  in particular cerebellar ataxia  They are a system of slow repetitious exercises  They increase in difficulty over the time of the program  The patient watches his hand or arm movements  for example  and corrects them as needed  Although the technique is simple  needs virtually no exercise equipment  and can be done on one s own  concentration and some degree of perseverance is required  Research has shown that        to        repetitions may be required to produce results  A simple calculation will show that this can be achieved by doing    repetitions every hour for six weeks in a    hour daily waking period  The repetitions will take just a few minutes every hour  The brain as a whole learns to compensate for motor deficits in the cerebellum  or the spinal cord where applicable   If the ataxia affects say  head movements  the patient can use a mirror or combination of mirrors to watch their own head movements Gait trainingGait training or gait rehabilitation is the act of learning how to walk  either as a child  or  more frequently  after sustaining an injury or disability  Physical therapists  or physiotherapists  generally help their patients with gait training  Gait training can take a number of forms  but repetition of the actual motions performed during walking is the most important factor  Parallel bars may be used to help with gait training  especially in the early stages when a patient is first learning or re learning to walk  They involve a person walking between two handrails to support themselves  often with the therapist either helping to support the patient or physically moving the patient s legs  Gait trainer or other gait aids are also utilized  In recent years there have been advancements in how the patient can increase the duration of therapy safely to make for more effective treatment  Body weight support  BWS  systems or unweighting devices are starting to become more and more popular and have been the subject of much study  BWS systems can be used prior to the patient gaining adequate motor control or having sufficient strength to fully bear weight  The patient will wear a specialized trunk harness with adjustable straps  which attach to an overhead suspension system  The harness and its attachments support a certain amount of the patient s body weight  Gait training techniques that utilize a BWS system appear to be promising in their ability to improve and possibly restore walking function  as demonstrated in individuals suffering from incomplete spinal cord injuries  A BWS system can be used on a treadmill or over ground for gait training  Body weight supported treadmill training  BWSTT  enables individuals with motor deficits that have rendered them incapable of completely supporting their own body weight to practice and experience locomotion at physiological speeds  Depending on the severity of the person s impairment  one or more physiotherapists may be present to assist in maintaining the patient s appropriate posture and moving their legs through as kinematically physiological a gait pattern as possible  Recently  electromechanical devices such as the Hocoma Lokomat robot driven gait orthosis have been introduced with the intention of reducing the physical labour demands on therapists  This system uses a computer controlled exoskeleton to repeatedly and consistently guide lower limb movements  making BWSTT a more feasible option for long term and widespread use  Another device category  so called end effector gait trainers  activates the human gait pattern over moving foot plates as opposed to an orthosis  The German society for Neurorehabilitation has recently recommended end effector devices for gait rehabilitation after stroke due to current medical evidence  Treadmill training  with or without a body weight support  is an emerging therapy and is being used with stroke patients to improve kinematic gait parameters  These patients often present with significant gait deviations and body weight supported treadmill training can provide an intense repetitive practice of a more natural gait pattern  Literature continues to emerge examining the influence treadmill speed may have on the improvement of gait patterns and functional independence  Research has shown that a greater gain in independent walking ability is seen in hemiparetic stroke patients who participate in structured speed dependent treadmill training compared to conventional training  Improvements in gait parameters included walking speed  cadence  stride length and Functional Ambulation Category scores  In speed dependent treadmill training  belt speed is increased to the maximum achievable speed the patient can maintain for    seconds without stumbling  followed by a period of recovery  If the patient were capable of maintaining the speed safely and comfortably during the    second bout  it would then be increased by     in the next attempt  following the same work and recovery procedures  Research has shown that this form of gait training demonstrates a more normal walking pattern without the compensatory movements commonly associated with stroke  Although gait training with parallel bars  treadmills and support systems can be beneficial  the long term aim of gait training is usually to reduce patients  dependence on such technology in order to walk more in their daily lives  Gait training can be useful for people with the following conditions  Amputation Osteoarthritis Muscular dystrophy Cerebral palsy Stroke Parkinson s disease Multiple sclerosis Brain and spinal cord injuries After surgery Sports injury Gait training for neurologic patients  also called locomotion therapy  many times is performed on treadmills while   therapists assisting the patients leg to move forward step by step  This is extremely exhausting for the therapists who many times have unergonomic working position and thus not only suffering from fatigue but also from back and shoulder pain  Help is given by a very reasonable priced new gait training and gait correction system called robowalk expander  designed and launched by h p cosmos sport   medical gmbh in Germany  robowalk allows to reduce required therapists from   to only   and the power and labour intensive task is done by expander cables  How does the new h p cosmos robowalk  expander work  First  elastic cables are attached to patient s legs with comfortable leg cuffs  As the patient walks  the cables at the front assist the movement of the legs with support  The cables at the rear can be used also as resistance and for gait correction training  Both the front and back system can be utilized together for even greater training effects  By adjusting the angle of the support resistance cables either vertically or horizontally  movement correction is possible  The patented tension adjustment module involves readable scales on each cable for tension monitoring    gait training and gait correction for orthopaedic or neurological patients   gait improvement   motion support   mobilization of spastic

c        often Anglicized as Galen and better known as Galen of Pergamon     e l n    was a prominent Greek physician  surgeon and philosopher in the Roman Empire  Arguably the most accomplished of all medical researchers of antiquity  Galen influenced the development of various scientific disciplines  including anatomy  physiology  pathology  pharmacology  and neurology  as well as philosophy and logic  The son of Aelius Nicon  a wealthy architect with scholarly interests  Galen received a comprehensive education that prepared him for a successful career as a physician and philosopher  Born in Pergamon  present day Bergama  Turkey   Galen traveled extensively  exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in Rome  where he served prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several emperors  Galen s understanding of anatomy and medicine was principally influenced by the then current theory of humorism  also known as the four humors   black bile  yellow bile  blood  and phlegm   as advanced by ancient Greek physicians such as Hippocrates  His theories dominated and influenced Western medical science for more than       years  His anatomical reports  based mainly on dissection of monkeys  especially the Barbary macaque  and pigs  remained uncontested until       when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections were published in the seminal work De humani corporis fabrica by Andreas Vesalius where Galen s physiological theory was accommodated to these new observations  Galen s theory of the physiology of the circulatory system endured until       when William Harvey published his treatise entitled De motu cordis  in which he established that blood circulates  with the heart acting as a pump  Medical students continued to study Galen s writings until well into the   th century  Galen conducted many nerve ligation experiments that supported the theory  which is still accepted today  that the brain controls all the motions of the muscles by means of the cranial and peripheral nervous systems  Galen saw himself as both a physician and a philosopher  as he wrote in his treatise entitled That the Best Physician is Also a Philosopher  Galen was very interested in the debate between the rationalist and empiricist medical sects  and his use of direct observation  dissection and vivisection represents a complex middle ground between the extremes of those two viewpoints  Many of his works have been preserved and or translated from the original Greek  although many were destroyed and some credited to him are believed to be spurious  Although there is some debate over the date of his death  he was no younger than seventy when he died  In medieval Europe  Galen s writings on anatomy became the mainstay of the medieval physician s university curriculum  but by that time they suffered greatly from stasis and intellectual stagnation  Some of Galen s ideas were incorrect  he did not dissect a human body  nor did the medieval lecturers  Galen s original Greek texts gained renewed prominence during the early modern period  In the     s  Belgian anatomist and physician Andreas Vesalius took on a project to translate many of Galen s Greek texts into Latin  Vesalius s most famous work  De humani corporis fabrica  was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form GeriatricsGeriatrics or geriatric medicine is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people  It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults  There is no set age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician or geriatric physician  a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people  Rather  this decision is determined by the individual patient s needs  and the availability of a specialist  It is important to note the difference between geriatrics  the care of aged people  and gerontology  which is the study of the aging process itself  The term geriatrics comes from the Greek       geron meaning  old man   and        iatros meaning  healer   However  geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology GoutGout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red  tender  hot  and swollen joint  Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours  The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases  It may also result in tophi  kidney stones  or urate nephropathy  Gout is due to elevated levels of uric acid in the blood  This occurs due to a combination of diet and genetic factors  At high levels  uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints  tendons and surrounding tissues  resulting in an attack of gout  Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat  drink a lot of beer  or are overweight  Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus  Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack  Treatment with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  NSAIDs   steroids  or colchicine improves symptoms  Once the acute attack subsides  levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes and in those with frequent attacks  allopurinol or probenecid provides long term prevention  Taking vitamin C and eating a diet high in low fat dairy products may be preventive  Gout affects about   to    of the Western population at some point in their lives  It has become more common in recent decades  This is believed to be due to increasing risk factors in the population  such as metabolic syndrome  longer life expectancy and changes in diet  Older males are most commonly affected  Gout was historically known as  the disease of kings  or  rich man s disease   It has been recognized at least since the time of the ancient Egyptians Gross motor skillGross motor skills are the abilities usually acquired during infancy and early childhood as part of a child s motor development  By the time they reach two years of age  almost all children are able to stand up  walk and run  walk up stairs  etc  These skills are built upon  improved and better controlled throughout early childhood  and continue in refinement throughout most of the individual s years of development into adulthood  These gross movements come from large muscle groups and whole body movement  These skills develop in a head to toe order  The children will typically learn head control  trunk stability  and then standing up and walking   Humphrey GymnasticonThe Gymnasticon was an early exercise machine resembling a stationary bicycle  invented in      by Francis Lowndes  Its function was to exercise the joints  either  in all parts of the body at once  or partially  Hand TherapyHand Therapy is a peer reviewed academic journal that publishes papers four times a year in the field of Physical medicine and rehabilitation  The journal s Editor in Chief is Christina Jerosch Herold  University of East Anglia  Norwich   It has been in publication since      and is currently published by SAGE Publications in association with the British Association of Hand Therapists and the European Federation of Societies for Hand Therapy Health clubA health club  also known as a fitness club  fitness centre  health spa  and commonly referred to as a gym  is a place that houses exercise equipment for the purpose of physical exercise HealthHealth is the level of functional and metabolic efficiency of a living organism  In humans it is the ability of individuals or communities to adapt and self manage when facing physical  mental or social changes  The World Health Organization  WHO  defined health in its broader sense in its      constitution as  a state of complete physical  mental  and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity   This definition has been subject to controversy  in particular as lacking operational value  the ambiguity in developing cohesive health strategies  and because of the problem created by use of the word  complete   Other definitions have been proposed  among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction   Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications  including the International Classification of Functioning  Disability and Health  ICF  and the International Classification of Diseases  ICD   are commonly used to define and measure the components of health Myocardial infarctionMyocardial infarction  MI  or acute myocardial infarction  AMI   commonly known as a heart attack  occurs when blood flow stops to a part of the heart causing damage to the heart muscle  The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder  arm  back  neck  or jaw  Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes  The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn  Other symptoms may include shortness of breath  nausea  feeling faint  a cold sweat  or feeling tired  About     of people have atypical symptoms  with women more likely than men to present atypically  Among those over    years old  about    have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms  An MI may cause heart failure  an irregular heartbeat  including serious types   cardiogenic shock  or cardiac arrest  Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease  Risk factors include high blood pressure  smoking  diabetes  lack of exercise  obesity  high blood cholesterol  poor diet  and excessive alcohol intake  among others  The mechanism of an MI often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque  MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms  which may be due to cocaine  significant emotional stress  and extreme cold  among others  A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis  including electrocardiograms  ECGs   blood tests  and coronary angiography  An ECG may confirm an ST elevation MI if ST elevation is present  Commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB  Aspirin is an appropriate immediate treatment for a suspected MI  Nitroglycerin or opioids may be used to help with chest pain  however  they do not improve overall outcomes  Supplemental oxygen should be used in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath  In ST elevation MIs treatments which attempt to restore blood flow to the heart are typically recommended and include percutaneous coronary intervention  PCI   where the arteries are pushed open and may be stented  or thrombolysis  where the blockage is removed using medications  People who have a non ST elevation myocardial infarction  NSTEMI  are often managed with the blood thinner heparin  with the additional use of PCI in those at high risk  In people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes  bypass surgery  CABG  may be recommended rather than angioplasty  After an MI  lifestyle modifications  along with long term treatment with aspirin  beta blockers  and statins  are typically recommended  Worldwide  about     million myocardial infarctions occurred in       More than   million people had an ST elevation MI and more than   million had an NSTEMI  STEMIs occur about twice as often in men as women  About one million people have an MI each year in the United States  In the developed world the risk of death in those who have had an STEMI is about      Rates of MI for a given age have decreased globally between      and      Heat therapyHeat therapy  also called thermotherapy  is the use of heat in therapy  such as for pain relief and health  It can take the form of a hot cloth  hot water bottle  ultrasound  heating pad  hydrocollator packs  whirlpool baths  cordless FIR heat therapy wraps  and others  It can be beneficial to those with arthritis and stiff muscles and injuries to the deep tissue of the skin  Heat may be an effective self care treatment for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis  Heat therapy is most commonly used for rehabilitation purposes  The therapeutic effects of heat include increasing the extensibility of collagen tissues  decreasing joint stiffness  reducing pain  relieving muscle spasms  reducing inflammation  edema  and aids in the post acute phase of healing  and increasing blood flow  The increased blood flow to the affected area provides proteins  nutrients  and oxygen for better healing HippocratesHippocrates of Kos   h  p kr  ti z   Greek              Hippokr t s  c        c      BC   also known as Hippocrates II  was a Greek physician of the Age of Pericles  Classical Greece   and is considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine  He is referred to as the  Father of Modern Medicine  in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic School of Medicine  This intellectual school revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece  establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields with which it had traditionally been associated  theurgy and philosophy   thus establishing medicine as a profession  However  the achievements of the writers of the Corpus  the practitioners of Hippocratic medicine  and the actions of Hippocrates himself were often commingled  thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought  wrote  and did  Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the paragon of the ancient physician  and credited with coining the Hippocratic Oath  still relevant and in use today  He is also credited with greatly advancing the systematic study of clinical medicine  summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools  and prescribing practices for physicians through the Hippocratic Corpus and other works HospiceHospice care is a type of care and philosophy of care that focuses on the palliation of a chronically ill  terminally ill or seriously ill patient s pain and symptoms  and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs  In Western society  the concept of hospice has been evolving in Europe since the   th century  Then  and for centuries thereafter in Roman Catholic tradition  hospices were places of hospitality for the sick  wounded  or dying  as well as those for travelers and pilgrims  The modern concept of hospice includes palliative care for the incurably ill given in such institutions as hospitals or nursing homes  but also care provided to those who would rather spend their last months and days of life in their own homes The first modern hospice care was created by Cicely Saunders in       Within the United States the term is largely defined by the practices of the Medicare system and other health insurance providers  which make hospice care available  either in an inpatient facility or at the patient s home  to patients with a terminal prognosis who are medically certified at hospice onset to have less than six months to live  Outside the United States  the term hospice tends to be primarily associated with the particular buildings or institutions that specialize in such care  although so called  hospice at home  services may also be available   Outside the United States such institutions may similarly provide care mostly in an end of life setting  but they may also be available for patients with other specific palliative care needs  Hospice care also involves assistance for patients  families to help them cope with what is happening and provide care and support to keep the patient at home  Although the movement has met with some resistance  hospice has rapidly expanded through the United Kingdom  the United States and elsewhere HumerusThe humerus    hju m r s   Plural  humeri  is a long bone in the arm or forelimb that runs from the shoulder to the elbow  It connects the scapula and the two bones of the lower arm  the radius and ulna  and consists of three sections  The humeral upper extremity consists of a rounded head  a narrow neck  and two short processes  tubercles  sometimes called tuberosities   The body is cylindrical in its upper portion  and more prismatic below  The lower extremity consists of   epicondyles    processes  trochlea   capitulum   and   fossae  radial fossa  coronoid fossa  and olecranon fossa   As well as its true anatomical neck  the constriction below the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus is referred to as its surgical neck due to its tendency to fracture  thus often becoming the focus of surgeons Humerus fractureA humerus fracture is a bone fracture of the bone of the upper arm  the humerus  Fractures of the humerus may be classified by the location of the fracture and divided into fractures of the proximal region  which is near the shoulder  the middle region  which is the shaft of the humerus  and the distal region  which is near the elbow  These locations can further be divided based on the extent of the fracture and the specific areas of each of the three regions affected  Humerus fractures usually occur after physical trauma  falls  excess physical stress  or pathological conditions  Falls are the most common cause of proximal and shaft fractures  and those who experience a fracture from a fall usually have an underlying risk factor for bone fracture  Distal fractures occur most frequently in children who experience physical trauma to the elbow area  Symptoms of fracture are pain  swelling  and discoloration of the skin at the site of the fracture  Bruising appears a few days after the fracture  The neurovascular bundle of the arm may be affected in severe cases  which will cause loss of nerve function and diminished blood supply beneath the fracture  Proximal and distal fractures will often cause a loss of shoulder or elbow function  Displaced shaft and distal fractures may cause deformity  and such shaft fractures will often shorten the length of the upper arm  Most humerus fractures are nondisplaced and will heal within a few weeks if the arm is immobilized  Severe displaced humerus fractures and complications often require surgical intervention  In most cases  normal function to the arm returns after the fracture is healed  In severe cases  however  function of the arm may be diminished after recovery HydrotherapyHydrotherapy  formerly called hydropathy and also called water cure  is a part of medicine and alternative medicine  in particular of naturopathy  occupational therapy and physiotherapy  that involves the use of water for pain relief and treatment  The term encompasses a broad range of approaches and therapeutic methods that take advantage of the physical properties of water  such as temperature and pressure  for therapeutic purposes  to stimulate blood circulation and treat the symptoms of certain diseases  Various therapies used in the present day hydrotherapy employ water jets  underwater massage and mineral baths  e g  balneotherapy  Iodine Grine therapy  Kneipp treatments  Scotch hose  Swiss shower  thalassotherapy  and or whirlpool bath  hot Roman bath  hot tub  Jacuzzi  cold plunge and mineral bath ICD    Procedure Coding SystemThe ICD    Procedure Coding System  ICD    PCS  is an international system of medical classification used for procedural coding  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  the agency responsible for maintaining the inpatient procedure code set in the U S   contracted with  M Health Information Systems in      to design and then develop a procedure classification system to replace Volume   of ICD   CM  ICD   CM contains a procedure classification  ICD    CM does not  ICD    PCS is the result  ICD    PCS was initially released in       It has been updated annually since that time ICD   CM Volume  ICD   CM Volume   is a system of procedural codes  It is a subset of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems  ICD    CM  Volumes   and   are used for diagnostic codes Independent medical examinationAn independent medical examination  IME  occurs when a doctor physical therapist chiropractor psychologist neuropsychologist who has not previously been involved in a person s care examines an individual  There is no doctor therapist patient relationship  IMEs may be conducted to determine the cause  extent and medical treatment of a work related or other injury where liability is at issue  whether an individual has reached maximum benefit from treatment  and whether any permanent impairment remains after treatment  An IME may be conducted at the behest of an employer or an insurance carrier to obtain an independent opinion of the clinical status of the individual  Workers  compensation insurance carriers  auto insurance carriers  and self insured employers have a legal right to this request  Should the doctor therapist performing the IME conclude that a patient s medical condition is not related to a compensable event  the insurer may deny the claim and refuse payment  Every state has different laws when it comes to Worker s Compensation and No Fault claims and every insurance company works differently  In a Massachusetts No Fault claim the insurance companies may require a report to be dictated by the doctor within    hours of the IME and sent to all parties of interest  In New York State  the Worker s Compensation Board allows the doctor    business days from the date of the IME to dictate the report and have it sent to all parties  Most often  there is an IME Vendor Company involved in which they schedule the exams  send out appointment letters  follow up with the doctors  proof read the reports for any errors or missed information  and finally  send out the reports to all parties  The insurance company just makes the request to a preferred IME vendor  and the vendor takes care of the rest  New York State has some very strict laws when it comes to Worker s Compensation  In some cases  a claimant may have what is called a C   Authorization case  which indicates the claimant needs surgery or Physical Therapy  The claimant s treating doctor will send a C   Authorization Request to the insurance adjuster  The adjuster then sends a referral to an IME Vendor and requests that per the Worker s Compensation Board  an IME is completed and the report is due back to all parties within    days of the treating doctor s request  If a vendor cannot supply a doctor who can book an appointment this soon  a File Review or Records Review may be proposed by the vendor to the insurance company  In this case  the doctor will not see the claimant  but will just review their medical records and dictate a report  The IME Vendor is usually instructed by the insurance company not to tell the claimant they are having a records review  In New York State  an MG   Request is similar in that the IME and report must be completed in    days  A Rocket Docket is a controverted claim  basically meaning that the insurance company is fighting the case  A report must be produced within    days of the pre trial hearing  An insurance company may request that an IME Vendor set up Surveillance on a claimant  Reason being  if the claimant says they have a broken collar bone and the surveillance catches them at the batting cages  now the insurance company can ask the IME doctor to review the footage and medical records  see the claimant and dictate a report  Adjusters have been known in the past to have checked on Facebook to find out what the claimant is doing lately  For example  if PTSD or depression is an alleged claim from an accident  but the claimant is out partying or going on tropical vacations and posting pictures  this could look rather suspicious  The adjuster will then ask that the doctor question the claimant on their hobbies  All of the above situations are because the insurance company has to pay for a claimant s treatment from an injury  So if a claimant is lying and doesn t require time off  benefits and treatment  the company doesn t want to pay for it  This is why it is always recommended that the claimant be as truthful as possible and attend their IME s  An IME is a second opinion exam  If you are truly injured  the IME doctor will note this in the report and recommend more treatment  An IME Vendor should try to schedule an exam within close range of the claimant  some insurance companies prefer within    miles  some prefer within      but in some cases  a specific type of doctor may not be available that close  so the vendor will ask the adjuster permission to schedule outside of that close range  If the adjuster approves it  the claimant may request transportation by calling the adjuster or the IME Vendor  If transportation is approved the insurance will cover this  If an interpreter is required  the insurance will also cover this  The adjuster or the IME Vendor then has certain companies they order interpretation transportation through  When an adjuster needs a New York State IME as quickly as possible due to a hearing or another urgent matter  a waiver can be signed by the claimant or their attorney  waiving their rights to   business days  notice of the appointment by mail  which is a law of the WCB   A common question from an IME Vendor  to a claimant or their attorney  may be to sign a waiver form  If the claimant signs this and goes to the appointment  this is okay  However  if an attorney s office refuses to sign it and won t let their client sign it  then the exam will have to be rescheduled to a later date to allow more notice time for the claimant  If a claimant attends the exam and their attorney says they ll sign the waiver  but never provides the signed waiver to the IME Vendor  the report that is dictated by the IME doctor will be precluded  meaning it is not valid because the waiver was never actually signed and returned    Integrated

ISBN  is a unique numeric commercial book identifier  An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation  except reprintings  of a book  For example  an e book  a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN  The ISBN is    digits long if assigned on or after   January       and    digits long if assigned before       The method of assigning an ISBN is nation based and varies from country to country  often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country  The initial ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in      based upon the

driven by the use of an electric current  Iontophoresis is to be distinguished from the carriage of uncharged molecules by diffusive fluxes of other molecules  especially of solvent molecules  for example by electro osmosis  that is to say by flux of uncharged solvent molecules carried as a cross effect of iontophoresis  These phenomena  directly and indirectly  constitute active transport of matter due to an applied electric current  The transport is measured in units of chemical flux  commonly  mol cm h  Iontophoresis has experimental  therapeutic and diagnostic applications Journal of

subject headings of the Quarterly Cumulative Index Medicus       edition  as precursors  The yearly printed version of MeSH was discontinued in      and MeSH is now available online only  It can be browsed and downloaded free of charge through PubMed  Originally in English  MeSH has been translated into numerous other languages and allows retrieval of documents from different languages Medical diagnosisMedical diagnosis  abbreviated Dx or DS  is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person s symptoms and signs  It is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit  The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care  Often  one or more diagnostic procedures  such as diagnostic tests  are also done during the process  Sometimes Posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis  Diagnosis is often challenging  because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific  For example  redness of the skin  erythema   by itself  is a sign of many disorders and thus doesn t tell the healthcare professional what is wrong  Thus differential diagnosis  in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted  must be performed  This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns  Occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom  or a group of several  that is pathognomonic  Diagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a doctor s visit  From the point of view of statistics  the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests Medical historyThe medical history or  medical  case history  also called epicrisis   typically discharge summary to referring GP  or anamnesis  especially historically   often abbreviated hx or Hx  of a patient is information gained by a physician by asking specific questions  either of the patient or of other people who know the person and can give suitable information  in this case  it is sometimes called heteroanamnesis   with the aim of obtaining information useful in formulating a diagnosis and providing medical care to the patient  The medically relevant complaints reported by the patient or others familiar with the patient are referred to as symptoms  in contrast with clinical signs  which are ascertained by direct examination on the part of medical personnel  Most health encounters will result in some form of history being taken  Medical histories vary in their depth and focus  For example  an ambulance paramedic would typically limit their history to important details  such as name  history of presenting complaint  allergies  etc  In contrast  a psychiatric history is frequently lengthy and in depth  as many details about the patient s life are relevant to formulating a management plan for a psychiatric illness  The information obtained in this way  together with the physical examination  enables the physician and other health professionals to form a diagnosis and treatment plan  If a diagnosis cannot be made  a provisional diagnosis may be formulated  and other possibilities  the differential diagnoses  may be added  listed in order of likelihood by convention  The treatment plan may then include further investigations to clarify the diagnosis MedicineMedicine  British English   m ds n   American English   m d s n   is the science and practice of the diagnosis  treatment  and prevention of disease  The word  medicine  is derived from Latin medicus  meaning  a physician   Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness  Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences  biomedical research  genetics  and medical technology to diagnose  treat  and prevent injury and disease  typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery  but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy  external splints and traction  medical devices  biologics  and ionizing radiation  amongst others  Medicine has existed for thousands of years  during most of which it was an art  an area of skill and knowledge  frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture  For example  a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing  or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism  In recent centuries  since the advent of modern science  most medicine has become a combination of art and science  both basic and applied  under the umbrella of medical science   While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice  the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science  Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine  They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine  For example  evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is  variable and inconsistent  for any condition  but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner  In contrast  treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery MontrealMontreal    m ntri   l     officially Montr al  French pronunciation   m   eal   is the most populous municipality in the Canadian province of Quebec and the  nd most populous in Canada as a whole  Originally called Ville Marie  or  City of Mary   it is believed to be named after Mount Royal  though there is some debate about this  The city occupies most of the Island of Montreal as well as many smaller peripheral islands  most significantly  le Bizard  The city has a distinct four season continental climate  with warm to hot summers and cold  snowy winters  In       Montreal had a population of            Montreal s metropolitan area had a population of           and a population of           in the urban agglomeration  with all of the municipalities on the Island of Montreal included  Legally a French speaking city        of Montrealers speak French at home        speak English and       speak other languages  Montreal is one of the most bilingual cities in Quebec and Canada  with     of the population able to speak both official languages  Montreal is the second largest primarily French speaking city in the world after Paris  Historically the commercial capital of Canada  it was surpassed in population and economic strength by Toronto in the     s  It remains an important centre of commerce  aerospace  finance  pharmaceuticals  technology  design  education  culture  tourism  gaming  film and world affairs  Being the location of the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization  Montreal is one of three North American cities home to organizations of the United Nations  along with New York and Washington  and also has the  nd highest number of consulates in the continent  Montreal was also named a UNESCO City of Design  In      Montreal was named North America s leading host city for international association events  according to the      preliminary rankings of the International Congress and Convention Association  ICCA   According to the      Global Liveability Ranking by the Economist Intelligence Unit  Montreal ranked   th out of     cities  In the      edition of their Best Student Cities ranking  Quacquarelli Symonds  QS  ranked Montreal as the world s best city to study abroad  Also  Montreal has    universities with         students enrolled  The Greater Montr al region has the highest number of university students per capita among all metropolitan areas in North America  It even ranks higher than Boston  the intellectual capital of the U S  Montreal has hosted multiple international conferences and events throughout its history  including the      International and Universal Exposition and the      Summer Olympic Games  It is the only Canadian city to have held the Summer Olympics  Currently  the city hosts the Canadian Grand Prix of Formula One  the Montreal International Jazz Festival and the Just for Laughs festival  In       Montreal was ranked as a Beta  world city Movement assessmentMovement assessment is the practice of analysing movement performance during functional tasks to determine the kinematics of individual joints and their effect on the kinetic chain  Three dimensional or two dimensional analysis of the biomechanics involved in sporting tasks can assist in prevention of injury and enhancing athletic performance  Identification of abnormal movement mechanics provides physical therapists with the ability to prescribe more accurate corrective exercise programs to prevent injury and improve exercise rehabilitation and progression following injury and assist in determining readiness to return to sport Multiple sclerosisMultiple sclerosis  MS  is a demyelinating disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged  This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate  resulting in a range of signs and symptoms  including physical  mental  and sometimes psychiatric problems  Specific symptoms can include double vision  blindness in one eye  muscle weakness  trouble with sensation  or trouble with coordination  MS takes several forms  with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks  relapsing forms  or building up over time  progressive forms   Between attacks  symptoms may disappear completely  however  permanent neurological problems often remain  especially as the disease advances  While the cause is not clear  the underlying mechanism is thought to be either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin producing cells  Proposed causes for this include genetics and environmental factors such as being triggered by a viral infection  MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests  There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis  Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks  Medications used to treat MS  while modestly effective  can have side effects and be poorly tolerated  Physical therapy can help with people s ability to function  Many people pursue alternative treatments  despite a lack of evidence  The long term outcome is difficult to predict  with good outcomes more often seen in women  those who develop the disease early in life  those with a relapsing course  and those who initially experienced few attacks  Life expectancy is on average   to    years lower than that of an unaffected population  Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system  In       about     million people were affected globally with rates varying widely in different regions and among different populations  That year about        people died from MS  up from        in       The disease usually begins between the ages of    and    and is twice as common in women as in men  MS was first described in      by Jean Martin Charcot  The name multiple sclerosis refers to the numerous scars  sclerae better known as plaques or lesions  that develop on the white matter of the brain and spinal cord  A number of new treatments and diagnostic methods are under development MuscleMuscle is a soft tissue found in most animals  Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another  producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell  Muscles function to produce force and motion  They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture  locomotion  as well as movement of internal organs  such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis  Muscle tissues are derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells in a process known as myogenesis  There are three types of muscle  skeletal or striated  cardiac  and smooth  Muscle action can be classified as being either voluntary or involuntary  Cardiac and smooth muscles contract without conscious thought and are termed involuntary  whereas the skeletal muscles contract upon command  Skeletal muscles in turn can be divided into fast and slow twitch fibers  Muscles are predominantly powered by the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates  but anaerobic chemical reactions are also used  particularly by fast twitch fibers  These chemical reactions produce adenosine triphosphate  ATP  molecules that are used to power the movement of the myosin heads  The term muscle is derived from the Latin musculus meaning  little mouse  perhaps because of the shape of certain muscles or because contracting muscles look like mice moving under the skin Human musculoskeletal systemThe human musculoskeletal system  also known as the locomotor system  and previously the activity system  is an organ system that gives humans the ability to move using their muscular and skeletal systems  The musculoskeletal system provides form  support  stability  and movement to the body  It is made up of the bones of the skeleton  muscles  cartilage  tendons  ligaments  joints  and other connective tissue that supports and binds tissues and organs together  The musculoskeletal system s primary functions include supporting the body  allowing motion  and protecting vital organs  The skeletal portion of the system serves as the main storage system for calcium and phosphorus and contains critical components of the hematopoietic system  This system describes how bones are connected to other bones and muscle fibers via connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments  The bones provide stability to the body  Muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones  To allow motion  different bones are connected by joints  Cartilage prevents the bone ends from rubbing directly onto each other  Muscles contract to move the bone attached at the joint  There are  however  diseases and disorders that may adversely affect the function and overall effectiveness of the system  These diseases can be difficult to diagnose due to the close relation of the musculoskeletal system to other internal systems  The musculoskeletal system refers to the system having its muscles attached to an internal skeletal system and is necessary for humans to move to a more favorable position  Complex issues and injuries involving the musculoskeletal system are usually handled by a physiatrist  specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation  or an orthopaedic surgeon National Diet LibraryThe National Diet Library  NDL            Kokuritsu Kokkai Toshokan  is the only national library in Japan  It was established in      for the purpose of assisting members of the National Diet of Japan      Kokkai  in researching matters of public policy  The library is similar in purpose and scope to the United States Library of Congress  The National Diet Library  NDL  consists of two main facilities in Tokyo and Kyoto  and several other branch libraries throughout Japan Neurological disorderA neurological disorder is any disorder of the nervous system  Structural  biochemical or electrical abnormalities in the brain  spinal cord or other nerves can result in a range of symptoms  Examples of symptoms include paralysis  muscle weakness  poor coordination  loss of sensation  seizures  confusion  pain and altered levels of consciousness  There are many recognized neurological disorders  some relatively common  but many rare  They may be assessed by neurological examination  and studied and treated within the specialities of neurology and clinical neuropsychology  Interventions for neurological disorders include preventative measures  lifestyle changes  physiotherapy or other therapy  neurorehabilitation  pain management  medication  or operations performed by neurosurgeons  The World Health Organization estimated in      that neurological disorders and their sequelae  direct consequences  affect as many as one billion people worldwide  and identified health inequalities and social stigma discrimination as major factors contributing to the associated disability and suffering Rehabilitation  neuropsychology Rehabilitation of sensory and cognitive function typically involves methods for retraining neural pathways or training new neural pathways to regain or improve neurocognitive functioning that has been diminished by disease or trauma  Three common neuropsychological problems treatable with rehabilitation are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  ADHD   concussion  and spinal cord injury  Rehabilitation research and practices are a fertile area for clinical neuropsychologists and others NeurologyNeurology  from Greek          neuron  and the suffix         logia  study of   is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the nervous system  Neurology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of conditions and disease involving the central and peripheral nervous system  and its subdivisions  the autonomic nervous system and the somatic nervous system   including their coverings  blood vessels  and all effector tissue  such as muscle  Neurological practice relies heavily on the field of neuroscience  which is the scientific study of the nervous system  A neurologist is a physician specializing in neurology and trained to investigate  or diagnose and treat neurological disorders  Neurologists may also be involved in clinical research  clinical trials  and basic or translational research  While neurology is a non surgical specialty  its corresponding surgical specialty is neurosurgery NeurophysiotherapyNeurophysiotherapy  or neurological physiotherapy  is a branch of physiotherapy which treats motor deficits arising from pathology in the nervous system Occupational therapyOccupational therapy  OT  is the use of assessment and treatment to develop  recover  or maintain the daily living and work skills of people with a physical  mental  or cognitive disorder  Occupational therapists also focus much of their work on identifying and eliminating environmental barriers to independence and participation in daily activities  Occupational therapists work with clients of all ages  ranging from infants to the elderly  Occupational therapy interventions focus on adapting the environment  modifying the task  teaching the skill  and educating the client family in order to increase participation in and performance of daily activities  particularly those that are meaningful to the client  Occupational therapists often work closely with professionals in physical therapy  speech therapy  nursing  social work  and the community  The term  Occupational therapy  can often be confusing  It carries the misconception that the profession s focus is on vocational counseling and job training  The word occupation as defined in Webster s Dictionary is  an activity in which one engages   Occupational therapists promote skill development and independence in all daily activities  For an adult  this may mean looking at the areas of self care  home making  leisure  and work  The  occupations  of childhood may include playing in the park with friends  washing hands  going to the bathroom  cutting with scissors  drawing  etc OncologyOncology is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention  diagnosis and treatment of cancer  A medical professional who practices oncology is an oncologist  The name s etymological origin is the Greek word         nkos   meaning  tumor    volume  or  mass   The three components which have improved survival in cancer are  Prevention   This is by reduction of risk factors like tobacco and alcohol consumption Early diagnosis   Screening of common cancers and comprehensive diagnosis and staging Treatment   Multimodality management by discussion in tumor board and treatment in a comprehensive cancer centre Cancers are often managed through discussion on multi disciplinary cancer conferences where medical oncologist  surgical oncologist  radiation oncologist  pathologist  radiologist and organ specific oncologists meet to find the best possible management for an individual patient considering the physical  social  psychological  emotional and financial status of the patients  It is very important for oncologists to keep updated of the latest advancements in oncology  as changes in management of cancer are quite common  All eligible patients in whom cancer progresses and for whom no standard of care treatment options are available should be enrolled in a clinical trial Orthopedic surgeryOrthopedic surgery or orthopedics  alternatively spelled orthopaedic surgery and orthopaedics  is the branch of surgery concerned with conditions involving the musculoskeletal system  Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat musculoskeletal trauma  spine diseases  sports injuries  degenerative diseases  infections  tumors  and congenital disorders Orthopedic surgeryOrthopedic surgery or orthopedics  alternatively spelled orthopaedic surgery and orthopaedics  is the branch of surgery concerned with conditions involving the musculoskeletal system

 Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat musculoskeletal trauma  spine diseases  sports injuries  degenerative diseases  infections  tumors  and congenital disorders OsteoporosisOsteoporosis is a disease where decreased bone strength increases the risk of a broken bone  It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly  Bones that commonly break include the back bones  the bones of the forearm  and the hip  Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms  Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously  Chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone  Osteoporosis may be due to lower than normal peak bone mass and greater than normal bone loss  Bone loss increases after menopause due to lower levels of estrogen  Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments including alcoholism  anorexia  hyperthyroidism  surgical removal of the ovaries  and kidney disease  Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss including some antiseizure medications  chemotherapy  proton pump inhibitors  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and steroids  Not enough exercise and smoking are also risk factors  Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of     standard deviations below that of a young adult  This is typically measured by dual energy X ray absorptiometry at the hip  Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that cause the condition  Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet  exercise  and fall prevention  Lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol may help  Medication of the bisphosphonate type are useful in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis  In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones they are less effective  A number of other medications may also be useful  Osteoporosis becomes more common with age  About     of white people in their   s and     of those over    are affected  It is more common in women than men  In the developed world  depending on the method of diagnosis     to    of males and    to     of females are affected  Rates of disease in the developing world are unclear  About    million women and     million men in the European Union had osteoporosis in       In the United States in      about eight million women and one to two million men had osteoporosis  White and Asian people are at greater risk  The word osteoporosis is from the Greek terms for  porous bones  ClinicA clinic  or outpatient clinic or ambulatory care clinic  is a healthcare facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients  Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded  They typically cover the primary healthcare needs of populations in local communities  in contrast to larger hospitals which offer specialised treatments and admit inpatients for overnight stays  Most commonly  the word clinic in English refers to a general medical practice  run by one or more general practitioners  but it can also mean a specialist clinic  Some clinics retain the name  clinic  even while growing into institutions as large as major hospitals or becoming associated with a hospital or medical school Pain managementPain management  pain medicine  pain control or algiatry  is a branch of medicine employing an interdisciplinary approach for easing the suffering and improving the quality of life of those living with chronic pain The typical pain management team includes medical practitioners  pharmacists  clinical psychologists  physiotherapists  occupational therapists  physician assistants  nurse practitioners  and clinical nurse specialists  The team may also include other mental health specialists and massage therapists  Pain sometimes resolves promptly once the underlying trauma or pathology has healed  and is treated by one practitioner  with drugs such as analgesics and  occasionally  anxiolytics  Effective management of chronic  long term  pain  however  frequently requires the coordinated efforts of the management team  Medicine treats injury and pathology to support and speed healing  and treats distressing symptoms such as pain to relieve suffering during treatment and healing  When a painful injury or pathology is resistant to treatment and persists  when pain persists after the injury or pathology has healed  and when medical science cannot identify the cause of pain  the task of medicine is to relieve suffering  Treatment approaches to chronic pain include pharmacological measures  such as analgesics  antidepressants and anticonvulsants  interventional procedures  physical therapy  physical exercise  application of ice and or heat  and psychological measures  such as biofeedback and cognitive behavioral therapy Parkinson s diseaseParkinson s disease  PD  is a long term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system  The symptoms generally come on slowly over time  Early in the disease  the most obvious are shaking  rigidity  slowness of movement  and difficulty with walking  Thinking and behavioral problems may also occur  Dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease  Depression and anxiety are also common occurring in more than a third of people with PD  Other symptoms include sensory  sleep  and emotional problems  The main motor symptoms are collectively called  parkinsonism   or a  parkinsonian syndrome   The cause of Parkinson s disease is generally unknown  but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors  Those with a family member affected are more likely to get the disease themselves  There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea  The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra  a region of the midbrain  This results in not enough dopamine in these areas  The reason for this cell death is poorly understood  but involves the build up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons  Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms  with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases  There is no cure for Parkinson s disease  Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication L DOPA  levodopa   with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective  As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost  these medications become less effective while at the same time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements  Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms  Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective  Evidence for treatments for the non movement related symptoms of PD  such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems  is less strong  In       PD was present in    million people and resulted in about         deaths globally  Parkinson s disease typically occurs in people over the age of     of which about one percent are affected  Males are more often affected than females  When it is seen in people before the age of     it is called young onset PD  The average life expectancy following diagnosis is between   and    years  The disease is named after the English doctor James Parkinson  who published the first detailed description in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy  in       Public awareness campaigns include World Parkinson s Day  on the birthday of James Parkinson     April  and the use of a red tulip as the symbol of the disease  People with parkinsonism who have increased the public s awareness of the condition include actor Michael J  Fox  Olympic cyclist Davis Phinney  and late professional boxer Muhammad Ali Pediatrics  journal Pediatrics is a peer reviewed medical journal published by the American Academy of Pediatrics  In the inaugural January      issue  the journal s first editor in chief  Hugh McCulloch  articulated the journal s vision   The content of the journal is    intended to encompass the needs of the whole child in his physiologic  mental  emotional  and social structure  The single word  Pediatrics  has been chosen to indicate this catholic intent   Pediatrics has been continuously published by the American Academy of Pediatrics since January       According to the Journal Citation Reports  the journal has a      impact factor of        ranking it fourth out of     journals in the category  Pediatrics  Pehr Henrik LingPehr Henrik Ling     November      in S dra Ljunga     May      in Stockholm  pioneered the teaching of physical education in Sweden  Ling is often mistakenly credited as the father of Swedish massage  though that title actually belongs to Johann Georg Mezger   Physical examinationA physical examination  medical examination  or clinical examination  more popularly known as a check up  is the process by which a medical professional investigates the body of a patient for signs of disease  It generally follows the taking of the medical history an account of the symptoms as experienced by the patient  Together with the medical history  the physical examination aids in determining the correct diagnosis and devising the treatment plan  This data then becomes part of the medical record  A Cochrane Collaboration meta study found that routine annual physicals did not measurably reduce the risk of illness or death  and conversely  could lead to over diagnosis and over treatment  The authors concluded that routine physicals were unlikely to do more good than harm Physical medicine and rehabilitationPhysical medicine and rehabilitation  PM R   also known as physiatry  f  za   tri  or rehabilitation medicine  or physical and rehabilitation medicine  PRM  outside of the United States  is a branch of medicine that aims to enhance and restore functional ability and quality of life to those with physical impairments or disabilities  A physician having completed training in this field is referred to as a physiatrist  Physiatrists specialize in restoring optimal function to people with injuries to the muscles  bones  ligaments  or nervous system Physical therapy educationPhysical therapy education varies greatly from country to country  Worldwide  physical therapy training ranges from basic work site education in hospitals and outpatient clinics to professional doctoral degree and masters programs Physical therapy practice actA physical therapy practice act is a statute defining the scope and practice of physical therapy within the jurisdiction  outlining licensing requirements for Physical Therapists and Physical Therapist Assistants  and establishing penalties for violations of the law  In the United States  each state enacts its own practice act  resulting in some variation among the states  though the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy  FSBPT  has drafted a model definition in order to limit this variation Physical therapyPhysical therapy  PT   also known as physiotherapy  is a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialty that  by using mechanical force and movements  remediates impairments and promotes mobility  function  and quality of life through examination  diagnosis  prognosis  and physical intervention  It is performed by physical therapists  known as physiotherapists in many countries   In addition to clinical practice  other activities encompassed in the physical therapy profession include research  education  consultation  and administration  Physical therapy services may be provided alongside  or in conjunction with  other medical services PoliomyelitisPoliomyelitis  often called polio or infantile paralysis  is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus  In about      of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move  This can occur over a few hours to few days  The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head  neck and diaphragm  Many but not all people fully recover  In those with muscle weakness about    to    of children and     to     of adults die  Another     of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to    have headache  neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs  These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks  In up to     of infections there are no symptoms  Years after recovery post polio syndrome may occur  with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection  Poliovirus is usually spread from person to person through infected fecal matter entering the mouth  It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva  Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present  The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood  The disease only occurs naturally in humans  The disease is preventable with the polio vaccine  however  a number of doses are required for it to be effective  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the disease is occurring  Once infected there is no specific treatment  In       polio affected    people  while there were about         cases in       In      the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan  Nigeria  and Pakistan  In      Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in       Poliomyelitis has existed for thousands of years  with depictions of the disease in ancient art  The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in      and the virus that causes it was first identified in      by Karl Landsteiner  Major outbreaks started to occur in the late   th century in Europe and the United States  In the   th century it became one of the most worrying childhood diseases in these areas  The first polio vaccine was developed in the     s by Jonas Salk  It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by      Polio vaccinePolio vaccines are vaccines used to prevent poliomyelitis  polio   There are two types  one that uses inactivated poliovirus and is given by injection  IPV   and one that uses weakened poliovirus and is given by mouth  OPV   The World Health Organization recommends all children be vaccinated against polio  The two vaccines have eliminated polio from most of the world  and reduced the number of cases each year from an estimated         in      to    in       The inactivated polio vaccines are very safe  Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection  Oral polio vaccines result in vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis in about three per million doses  This compares with one in two hundred who are paralysed following a polio infection  Both are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV AIDS but are otherwise well  The first polio vaccine was the inactivated polio vaccine  It was developed by Jonas Salk and came into use in       The oral polio vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in       They are on the World Health Organization s List of Essential Medicines  the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system  The wholesale cost in the developing world is about      USD per dose for the oral form as of       In the United States it costs between    and    USD for the inactivated form Postural RestorationPostural restoration is a posture based integrative treatment approach to physical medicine  It includes the science of postural adaptations  the influence of the respiratory system and polyarticular chains of muscle  and asymmetrical patterns  Treatment aims to maximize neutrality in the body through manual and non manual exercise techniques designed to reposition  retrain  and restore these asymmetrical patterned positions  It is used by some physical therapy and athletic trainers  There is little quality evidence on its usefulness in any health condition ProcoveryProcovery is a proprietary methodology focused on the process of how individuals with serious and chronic illnesses  trauma  addiction  injuries and loss can build healthier and more fulfilling lives  notwithstanding the possible continuing presence or worsening of symptoms or circumstances  The concept of Procovery was created by writer Kathleen Crowley in      and her program of Procovery principles and strategies  and Procovery Circles  resulted from years of research and interviews of individuals who found resilience  and those who supported and cared for them Professional associationA professional association  also called a professional body  professional organization  or professional society  is usually a nonprofit organization seeking to further a particular profession  the interests of individuals engaged in that profession and the public interest  The roles of these professional associations have been variously defined   A group of people in a learned occupation who are entrusted with maintaining control or oversight of the legitimate practice of the occupation   also a body acting  to safeguard the public interest   organizations which  represent the interest of the professional practitioners   and so  act to maintain their own privileged and powerful position as a controlling body   Many professional bodies are involved in the development and monitoring of professional educational programs  and the updating of skills  and thus perform professional certification to indicate that a person possesses qualifications in the subject area  Sometimes membership of a professional body is synonymous with certification  though not always  Membership of a professional body  as a legal requirement  can in some professions form the primary formal basis for gaining entry to and setting up practice within the profession  see licensure  Many professional bodies also act as learned societies for the academic disciplines underlying their professions  As a practical matter  most professional organizations of global scope  see List of professional organizations  are located in the United States  The U S  has often led the transformation of various occupations into professions  a process described in the academic literature as professionalization PubMed CentralPubMed Central  PMC  is a free digital repository that archives publicly accessible full text scholarly articles that have been published within the biomedical and life sciences journal literature  As one of the major research databases within the suite of resources that have been developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information  NCBI   PubMed Central is much more than just a document repository  Submissions into PMC undergo an indexing and formatting procedure which results in enhanced metadata  medical ontology  and unique identifiers which all enrich the XML structured data for each article on deposit  Content within PMC can easily be interlinked to many other NCBI databases and accessed via Entrez search and retrieval systems  further enhancing the public s ability to freely discover  read and build upon this portfolio of biomedical knowledge  PubMed Central should not be confused with PubMed  These are two very different services at their core  While PubMed is a searchable database of biomedical citations and abstracts  the full text article referenced in the PubMed record will physically reside elsewhere   Sometimes in print  sometimes online  sometimes free  sometimes behind a toll wall accessible only to paying subscribers   PubMed Central is a free digital archive of articles  accessible to anyone from anywhere via a basic web browser  The full text of all PubMed Central articles is free to read  with varying provisions for reuse  As of February       the PMC archive contained over     million articles  with contributions coming directly from publishers or authors depositing their own manuscripts into the repository per the NIH Public Access Policy  Recent data shows that in the past year  Jan        Jan       author initiated deposits exceeded         papers during just this    month period  PMC also identifies about       journals which now participate in some capacity to automatically deposit their published content into the PMC repository  Some participating publishers will delay the release of their articles on PubMed Central for a set time after publication  this is often referred to as an  embargo period   and can range from a few months to a few years depending on the journal   Embargoes of six to twelve months are the most common  PubMedPubMed is a free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics  The United States National Library of Medicine  NLM  at the National Institutes of Health maintains the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval  From      to       MEDLINE online access to the MEDLARS Online computerized database primarily had been through institutional facilities  such as university libraries  PubMed  first released in January       ushered in the era of private  free  home  and office based MEDLINE searching  The PubMed system was offered free to the public in June       when MEDLINE searches via the Web were demonstrated  in a ceremony  by Vice President Al Gore LungThe lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails  In mammals and most other vertebrates  two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart  Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream  and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere  in a process of gas exchange  Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species  Mammals  reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing  In early tetrapods  air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping  a mechanism still seen in amphibians  In humans  the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm  The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible  Humans have two lungs  a right lung and a left lung  They are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest  The right lung is bigger than the left  which shares space in the chest with the heart  The lungs together weigh approximately     kilograms      lb   and the right is heavier  The lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone  These divide until air reaches microscopic alveoli  where the process of gas exchange takes place  Together  the lungs contain approximately       kilometres        mi  of airways and     to     million alveoli  The lungs are enclosed within the pleural sac which allows the inner and outer walls to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place  without much friction  This sac encloses each lung and also divides each lung into sections called lobes  The right lung has three lobes and the left has two  The lobes are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments and lobules  The lungs have a unique blood supply  receiving deoxygenated blood sent from the heart for the purposes of receiving oxygen  the pulmonary circulation  and a separate supply of oxygenated blood  the bronchial circulation   The tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of diseases  including pneumonia and lung cancer  Chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema can be related to smoking or exposure to harmful substances  Diseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract  In embryonic development  the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the foregut  a tube which goes on to form the upper part of the digestive system  When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe  Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus  At birth however  air begins to pass through the lungs  and the diversionary duct closes  so that the lungs can begin to respire  The lungs only fully develop in early childhood  Medical terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo   from the Latin pulmonarius  of the lungs  as in pulmonology  or with pneumo   from Greek          lung   as in pneumonia Pulmonary fibrosisPulmonary fibrosis  literally  scarring of the lungs   is a respiratory disease in which scars are formed in the lung tissues  leading to serious breathing problems  Scar formation  the accumulation of excess fibrous connective tissue  the process called fibrosis   leads to thickening of the walls  and causes reduced oxygen supply in the blood  As a consequence patients suffer from perpetual shortness of breath  In some patients the specific cause of the disease can be diagnosed  but in others the probable cause cannot be determined  a condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  There is no known cure for the scars and damage in the lung due to pulmonary fibrosis Reed CollegeReed College is a private liberal arts college in southeast Portland in the U S  state of Oregon  Founded in       Reed is a residential college with a campus in Portland s Eastmoreland neighborhood  featuring architecture based on the Tudor Gothic style  and a forested canyon nature preserve at its center  Reed is known for its mandatory freshman humanities program  required senior year thesis  and the unusually high proportion of graduates who go on to earn doctorates and other postgraduate degrees  The college has many prominent alumni  including over    Fulbright Scholars     Watson Fellows    MacArthur Fellows  and    Rhodes Scholars the second highest number of any liberal arts college Regulatory agencyA regulatory agency  also regulatory authority  regulatory body or regulator  is a public authority or government agency responsible for exercising autonomous authority over some area of human activity in a regulatory or supervisory capacity  An independent regulatory agency is a regulatory agency that is independent from other branches or arms of the government  Regulatory agencies deal in the areas of administrative law  regulatory law  secondary legislation  and rulemaking  codifying and enforcing rules and regulations and imposing supervision or oversight for the benefit of the public at large   The existence of independent regulatory agencies is justified by the complexity of certain regulatory and supervisory tasks that require expertise  the need for rapid implementation of public authority in certain sectors  and the drawbacks of political interference  Some independent regulatory agencies perform investigations or audits  and other may fine the relevant parties and order certain measures  Regulatory agencies are usually a part of the executive branch of the government  and they have statutory authority to perform their functions with oversight from the legislative branch  Their actions are generally open to legal review  Regulatory authorities are commonly set up to enforce standards and safety or to oversee use of public goods and regulate commerce  Examples of regulatory agencies are the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Food and Drug Administration in the United States  the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and Ofcom in the United Kingdom  and the Telecom Regulatory Authority in India  See Internet regulation in Turkey for additional examples Rehabilitation hospitalRehabilitation hospitals  also referred to as inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  are devoted to the rehabilitation of patients with various neurological  musculo skeletal  orthopedic and other medical conditions following stabilization of their acute medical issues  The industry is largely made up by independent hospitals that operate these facilities within acute care hospitals  There are also inpatient rehabilitation hospitals that offer this service in a hospital like setting  but separate from acute care facilities  Most inpatient rehabilitation facilities are located within hospitals    Rehabilitation hospitals were created to meet a perceived need for facilities which were less costly on a per diem basis than general hospitals but which provided a higher level of professional therapies such as speech therapy  occupational therapy  and physical therapy than can be obtained in a  skilled nursing care  facility  Rehabilitation hospitals are designed to meet the requirements imposed upon them by the Medicare administration  and to bill at the rates allowed by Medicare for such a facility  Medicare allows a lifetime total of     days  stay in a rehabilitation hospital per person  A rehabilitation hospital can only be accessed following a stay as an inpatient in a general hospital which has lasted for a certain number of days  The general hospital will evaluate the patient to determine if the patient will benefit from rehabilitation services  A positive determination will be made if the patient is deemed to require a certain level of therapies  If a positive determination is made  a report concerning the patient s needs will be sent to the rehabilitation hospital  which has the discretion to admit or not admit the patient  If the patient is transferred to the rehabilitation hospital  his her medical records and a recommended treatment plan will be transmitted with the patient  The treatment plan will include daily therapies except on weekends  Some rehabilitation hospitals have physicians on staff  others do not Respiratory therapistA respiratory therapist is a specialized healthcare practitioner trained in pulmonary medicine in order to work therapeutically with people suffering from pulmonary disease  who has graduated from a university and passed a national board certifying examination  Respiratory therapists work most often in intensive care and operating rooms  but are also found in outpatient clinics and home health environments  Respiratory therapists are specialists and educators in cardiology and pulmonology  Respiratory therapists are clinicians trained in advanced airway management  establishing and maintaining the airway during management of trauma  intensive care  and may administer anaesthesia for surgery or conscious sedation  Respiratory therapists initiate and manage life support for people in intensive care units and emergency departments  stabilizing  treating and managing pre hospital and hospital to hospital patient transport by air or ground ambulance  In the outpatient setting Respiratory Therapists work as educators in asthma clinics  ancillary clinical staff in pediatric clinics  and sleep disorder diagnosticians in sleep clinics  They also serve as clinical providers in cardiology clinics and cath labs Movement assessmentMovement assessment is the practice of analysing movement performance during functional tasks to determine the kinematics of individual joints and their effect on the kinetic chain  Three dimensional or two dimensional analysis of the biomechanics involved in sporting tasks can assist in prevention of injury and enhancing athletic performance  Identification of abnormal movement mechanics provides physical therapists with the ability to prescribe more accurate corrective exercise programs to prevent injury and improve exercise rehabilitation and progression following injury and assist in determining readiness to return to sport SchoolA school is an institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students  or  pupils   under the direction of teachers  Most countries have systems of formal education  which is commonly compulsory  In these systems  students progress through a series of schools  The names for these schools vary by country  discussed in the Regional section below  but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education  An institution where higher education is taught  is commonly called a university college or university  In addition to these core schools  students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary and secondary education  Kindergarten or pre school provide some schooling to very young children  typically ages       University  vocational school  college or seminary may be available after secondary school  A school may also be dedicated to one particular field  such as a school of economics or a school of dance  Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods  There are also non government schools  called private schools  Private schools may be required when the government does not supply adequate  or special education  Other private schools can also be religious  such as Christian schools  hawzas  Muslim schools   yeshivas  Jewish schools   and others  or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements  Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training  military education and training and business schools  In homeschooling and online schools  teaching and learning take place outside of a traditional school building  Schools are commonly organized in several different organizational models  including departmental  small learning communities  academies  integrated  and schools within a school ScoliosisScoliosis is a medical condition in which a person s spine has a sideways curve  The curve is usually  S   or  C  shaped  In some the degree of curve is stable  while in others it increases over time  Mild scoliosis does not typically cause problems  while severe cases can interfere with breathing  Pain is typically not present  The cause of most cases is unknown but believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors  Risk factors include other affected family members  It can also occur due to another condition such as muscles spasms  cerebral palsy  Marfan syndrome  and tumors such as neurofibromatosis  Diagnosis is confirmed with plain X rays  Scoliosis is typically classified as either structural in which the curve is fixed or functional in which the underlying spine is normal  Treatment depends on the degree of curve  location  and cause  Minor curves may simply be watched periodically  Treatments may include bracing or surgery  The brace must be fitted to the person and used daily until growing stops  Evidence for chiropractic manipulation  dietary supplements  and exercises to prevent worsening is lacking  Exercise  however  is still recommended due to its other benefits  Scoliosis occurs in about    of people  It most commonly occurs between the ages of ten and twenty  Girls typically are more severely affected than boys  The term is from Ancient Greek            skoliosis which means  a bending  Sensory processingSensory processing is the process that organizes sensation from one s own body and the environment  thus making it possible to use the body effectively within the environment  Specifically  it deals with how the brain processes multiple sensory modality inputs  such as proprioception  vision  auditory system  tactile  olfactory  vestibular system  interoception  and taste into usable functional outputs  It has been believed for some time that inputs from different sensory organs are processed in different areas in the brain  The communication within and among these specialized areas of the brain is known as functional integration  Newer research has shown that these different regions of the brain may not be solely responsible for only one sensory modality  but could use multiple inputs to perceive what the body senses about its environment  Multisensory integration is necessary for almost every activity that we perform because the combination of multiple sensory inputs is essential for us to comprehend our surroundings ShoulderThe human shoulder is made up of three bones  the clavicle  collarbone   the scapula  shoulder blade   and the humerus  upper arm bone  as well as associated muscles  ligaments and tendons  The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints  The shoulder joint also known as the glenohumeral joint  is the major joint of the shoulder  but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint  In human anatomy  the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula  the head sitting in the glenoid cavity  The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint  The shoulder joint  also known as the glenohumeral joint  is the main joint of the shoulder  It is a ball and socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body  The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the scapula  humerus  and head of the biceps  It is lined by a thin  smooth synovial membrane  The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround the shoulder joint and contribute to the shoulder s stability  The muscles of the rotator cuff are supraspinatus  subscapularis  infraspinatus  and teres minor  The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches to the humeral head The shoulder must be mobile enough for the wide range actions of the arms and hands  but also stable enough to allow for actions such as lifting  pushing and pulling Dislocated shoulderA dislocated shoulder occurs when the humerus separates from the scapula at the shoulder joint  glenohumeral joint   The shoulder joint has the greatest range of motion of any joint  at the cost of low joint stability  and it is therefore particularly susceptible to subluxation  partial dislocation  and dislocation  Approximately half of major joint dislocations seen in emergency departments involve the shoulder Soft tissue therapySoft tissue therapy  STT  is the assessment  treatment and management of soft tissue injury  pain and dysfunction primarily of the neuromusculoskeletal system  Licensed health care professionals who typically provide soft tissue manual therapy include bodywork practitioners  such as massage therapists   occupational therapists  physical therapists and some chiropractic  osteopathic and naturopathic doctors  Typically  regulated healthcare professionals who provide soft tissue therapy have a background in anatomy  physiology  pathology  pathophysiology  biomechanics  and functional anatomy  as well as tactile palpatory and functional movement assessments Medical ultrasoundMedical ultrasound  also known as diagnostic sonography or ultrasonography  is a diagnostic imaging technique based on the application of ultrasound  It is used to see internal body structures such as tendons  muscles  joints  vessels and internal organs  Its aim is often to find a source of a disease or to exclude any pathology  The practice of examining pregnant women using ultrasound is called obstetric ultrasound  and is widely used  Ultrasound is sound waves with frequencies which are higher than those audible to humans          Hz   Ultrasonic images also known as sonograms are made by sending pulses of ultrasound into tissue using a probe  The sound echoes off the tissue  with different tissues reflecting varying degrees of sound  These echoes are recorded and displayed as an image to the operator  Many different types of images can be formed using sonographic instruments  The most well known type is a B mode image  which displays the acoustic impedance of a two dimensional cross section of tissue  Other types of image can display blood flow  motion of tissue over time  the location of blood  the presence of specific molecules  the stiffness of tissue  or the anatomy of a three dimensional region  Compared to other prominent methods of medical imaging  ultrasound has several advantages  It provides images in real time  it is portable and can be brought to the bedside  it is substantially lower in cost  and it does not use harmful ionizing radiation  Drawbacks of ultrasonography include various limits on its field of view including patient cooperation and physique  difficulty imaging structures behind bone and air  and its dependence on a skilled operator Speech language pathologySpeech language pathology is a field of expertise practiced by a clinician known as a speech language pathologist  SLP   also called speech and language therapist  or speech therapist  who specializes in the evaluation and treatment of communication disorders  cognition  voice disorders  and swallowing disorders  A common misconception is that speech language pathology is restricted to correcting pronunciation difficulties  such as helping English speaking individuals enunciate their  s  and  r  sounds  and helping people who stutter to speak more fluently  In fact  speech language pathology is concerned with a broad scope of speech  language  swallowing  and voice issues involving communication  some of which are  Word finding issues  either as a result of a specific language problem such as a language delay or a more general issue such as dementia  Social communication difficulties involving how people communicate ideas with others  pragmatics   Structural language impairments  including difficulties creating sentences that are grammatical  syntax  and meaningful  semantics   Literacy impairments  reading and writing  related to the letter to sound relationship  phonics   the word to meaning relationship  semantics   and understanding the ideas presented in a text  reading comprehension   Voice difficulties  such as a raspy voice  a voice that is too soft  or other voice difficulties that negatively impact a person s social or professional performance  Cognitive impairments  e g   attention  memory  executive function  to the extent that they interfere with communication  The components of speech production include  phonation  producing sound   resonance  fluency  Intonation  Pitch variance  Voice  including aeromechanical components of respiration  The components of language include  phonology  manipulating sound according to the rules of a language   Morphology  understanding and using minimal units of meaning   syntax  constructing sentences according to languages  grammar rules   semantics  interpreting signs or symbols of communication to construct meaning   pragmatics  social aspects of communication   Primary pediatric speech and language disorders include receptive and expressive language disorders  speech sound disorders  childhood apraxia of speech  stuttering  and language based learning disabilities  Swallowing disorders include difficulties in any system of the swallowing process  i e  oral  pharyngeal  esophageal   as well as functional dysphagia and feeding disorders  Swallowing disorders can occur at any age and can stem from multiple causes Spinal manipulationSpinal manipulation is an intervention performed on spinal articulations which are synovial joints  which is asserted to be therapeutic  These articulations in the spine that are amenable to spinal manipulative therapy include the z joints  the atlanto occipital  atlanto axial  lumbosacral  sacroiliac  costotransverse and costovertebral joints  National guidelines come to different conclusions with respect to spinal manipulation with some not recommending it  and others recommending a short course in those who do not improve with other treatments  A      Cochrane review found that spinal manipulation was no more or less effective than other commonly used therapies such as pain medication  physical therapy  exercises  back school or the care given by a general practitioner  There is not sufficient data to establish the safety of spinal manipulations   Splint  medicine A splint is a device used for support or immobilization of a limb or the spine  It can be used in multiple situations  including temporary immobilization of potentially broken bones or damaged joints and support for joints during activity SportSport  UK  or sports  US  are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which  through casual or organized participation  aim to use  maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants  and in some cases  entertainment for spectators  Usually the contest or game is between two sides  each attempting to exceed the other  Some sports allow a tie game  others provide tie breaking methods  to ensure one winner and one loser  A number of such two sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion  Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season  followed in some cases by playoffs  Hundreds of sports exist  from those between single contestants  through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants  either in teams or competing as individuals  In certain sports such as racing  many contestants may compete  each against each other  with one winner  Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity  with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition  and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports  However  a number of competitive  but non physical  activities claim recognition as mind sports  The International Olympic Committee  through ARISF  recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports  and SportAccord  the international sports federation association  recognises five non physical sports  bridge  chess  draughts  checkers   Go  and xiangqi  and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports  Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs  which serve to ensure fair competition  and allow consistent adjudication of the winner  Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first  It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance  including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression  Records of performance are often kept  and for popular sports  this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news  Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non participants  with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues  and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting  Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated  and in some cases is central to the sport  According to A T  Kearney  a consultancy  the global sporting industry is worth up to      billion as of       The world s most accessible and practised sport is running  while association football is the most popular spectator sport Sports medicineSports medicine  also known as sport and exercise medicine  SEM   is a branch of medicine that deals with physical fitness and the treatment and prevention of injuries related to sports and exercise  Although most sports teams have employed team physicians for many years  it is only since the late   th century that sports medicine has emerged as a distinct field of health care Practice  learning method Practice is the act of rehearsing a behavior over and over  or engaging in an activity again and again  for the purpose of improving or mastering it  as in the phrase  practice makes perfect   Sports teams practice to prepare for actual games  Playing a musical instrument well takes a lot of practice  It is a method of learning and of acquiring experience  The word derives from the Greek             praktike   feminine of              praktikos    fit for or concerned with action  practical   and that from the verb           prasso    to achieve  bring about  effect  accomplish   In American English  practice is used as both a noun and a verb  but in British English  there is a distinction between practice  used as a noun  and practise  used as a verb  see spelling differences   Sessions scheduled for the purpose of rehearsing and performance improvement are called practices  They are engaged in by sports teams  bands  individuals  etc   He went to football practice every day after school   for exampleStimulus modalityStimulus modality  also called sensory modality  is one aspect of a stimulus or what we perceive after a stimulus  For example  the temperature modality is registered after heat or cold stimulate a receptor  Some sensory modalities include  light  sound  temperature  taste  pressure  and smell  The type and location of the sensory receptor activated by the stimulus plays the primary role in coding the sensation  All sensory modalities work together to heighten stimuli sensation when necessary Strength trainingStrength training is a type of physical exercise specializing in the use of resistance to induce muscular contraction which builds the strength  anaerobic endurance  and size of skeletal muscles  When properly performed  strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well being  including increased bone  muscle  tendon and ligament strength and toughness  improved joint function  reduced potential for injury  increased bone density  increased metabolism  increased fitness  improved cardiac function  and improved lipoprotein lipid profiles  including elevated HDL   good   cholesterol  Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases and uses a variety of exercises and types of equipment to target specific muscle groups  Strength training is primarily an anaerobic activity  although some proponents have adapted it to provide the benefits of aerobic exercise through circuit training  Strength training is typically associated with the production of lactate  which is a limiting factor of exercise performance  Regular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which can prevent lactate levels from rising during strength training  This is mediated via activation of PGC  alpha which alter the LDH  lactate dehydrogenase  isoenzyme complex composition and decreases the activity of the lactate generating enzyme LDHA  while increasing the activity of the lactate metabolizing enzyme LDHB  Sports where strength training is central are bodybuilding  weightlifting  powerlifting  strongman  Highland games  shotput  discus throw  and javelin throw  Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen  notably tennis American football  wrestling  track and field  rowing  lacrosse  basketball  pole dancing  hockey  professional wrestling  rugby union  rugby league and soccer  Strength training for other sports and physical activities is becoming increasingly popular StrokeA stroke is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death  There are two main types of stroke  ischemic  due to lack of blood flow  and hemorrhagic  due to bleeding  They result in part of the brain not functioning properly  Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body  problems understanding or speaking  feeling like the world is spinning  or loss of vision to one side  Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred  If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack  TIA  or mini stroke  A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache  The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent  Long term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control  The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure  Other risk factors include tobacco smoking  obesity  high blood cholesterol  diabetes mellitus  previous TIA  and atrial fibrillation  An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel  though there are also less common causes  A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain s membranes  Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm  Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  scan along with a physical exam  Other tests such as an electrocardiogram  ECG  and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes  Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms  Prevention includes decreasing risk factors  as well as possibly aspirin  statins  surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing  and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation  A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care  An ischemic stroke  if detected within three to four and half hours  may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot  Aspirin should be used  Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from surgery  Treatment to try to recover lost function is called stroke rehabilitation and ideally takes place in a stroke unit  however  these are not available in much of the world  In      approximately     million people had an ischemic stroke and     million people had a hemorrhagic stroke  In      there were about    million people who had previously had a stroke and were still alive  Between      and      the number of strokes which occurred each year decreased by approximately     in the developed world and increased by     in the developing world  In       stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease  accounting for     million deaths      of the total   About     million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while     million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke  About half of people who have had a stroke live less than one year  Overall  two thirds of strokes occurred in those over    years old Systematic reviewA systematic review is a type of literature review that collects and critically analyzes multiple research studies or papers  A review of existing studies is often quicker and cheaper than embarking on a new study  Researchers use methods that are selected before one or more research questions are formulated  and then they aim to find and analyze studies that relate to and answer those questions  Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials are key in the practice of evidence based medicine  An understanding of systematic reviews  and how to implement them in practice  is highly recommended for professionals involved in the delivery of health care  Besides health interventions  systematic reviews may examine clinical tests  public health interventions  environmental interventions  social interventions  adverse effects  and economic evaluations  Systematic reviews are not limited to medicine and are quite common in all other sciences where data are collected  published in the literature  and an assessment of methodological quality for a precisely defined subject would be helpful Therapeutic ultrasoundTherapeutic ultrasound refers generally to any type of ultrasonic procedure that uses ultrasound for therapeutic benefit  This includes HIFU  lithotripsy  targeted ultrasound drug delivery  trans dermal ultrasound drug delivery  ultrasound hemostasis  cancer therapy  and ultrasound assisted thrombolysis  It may use focused ultrasound  FUS  or unfocused ultrasound  Ultrasound is a method of stimulating the tissue beneath the skin s surface using very high frequency sound waves  between         Hz and           Hz  which cannot be heard by humans Traction  orthopedics In orthopedic medicine  traction refers to the set of mechanisms for straightening broken bones or relieving pressure on the spine and skeletal system  There are two types of traction  skin traction and skeletal traction U S  stateA U S  state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America  There are    states  which are bound together in a union with each other  Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory  and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government  Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government  Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside  State citizenship and residency are flexible  and no government approval is required to move between states  except for persons covered by certain types of court orders  e g   paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody   States range in population from just under          Wyoming  to over    million  California   and in area from       square miles        km    Rhode Island  to         square miles            km    Alaska   Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names  States are divided into counties or county equivalents  which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign  County or county equivalent structure varies widely by state  State governments are allocated power by the people  of each respective state  through their individual constitutions  All are grounded in republican principles  and each provides for a government  consisting of three branches  executive  legislative  and judicial  States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution  among them ratifying constitutional amendments  Historically  the tasks of local law enforcement  public education  public health  regulating intrastate commerce  and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities  although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well  Over time  the U S  Constitution has been amended  and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed  The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation  with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did  There is a continuing debate over states  rights  which concerns the extent and nature of the states  powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals  States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress  a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives  Each state is represented in the Senate by two senators  and is guaranteed at least one Representative in the House  Members of the House are elected from single member districts  Representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census  Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College  the body that elects the President of the United States  equal to the total of representatives and senators from that state  The Constitution grants to

is a common and distressing problem  which may have a large impact on quality of life  It is twice as common in women as in men  Pregnancy  childbirth  and menopause are major risk factors  It has been identified as an important issue in geriatric health care  Urinary incontinence is often a result of an underlying medical condition but is under reported to medical practitioners  Enuresis is often used to refer to urinary incontinence primarily in children  such as nocturnal enuresis  bed wetting   There are four main types of incontinence  Urge incontinence due to an overactive bladder Stress incontinence due to poor closure of the bladder Overflow incontinence due to either poor bladder contraction or blockage of the urethra Functional incontinence due to medications or health problems making it difficult to reach the bathroom Treatments include pelvic floor muscle training  bladder training  and electrical stimulation  The benefit of medications is small and long term safety is unclear Women s healthWomen s health refers to the health of women  which differs from that of men in many unique ways  Women s health is an example of population health  where health is defined by the World Health Organization as  a state of complete physical  mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity   Often treated as simply women s reproductive health  many groups argue for a broader definition pertaining to the overall health of women  better expressed as  The health of women   These differences are further exacerbated in developing countries where women  whose health includes both their risks and experiences  are further disadvantaged  Although women in industrialised countries have narrowed the gender gap in life expectancy and now live longer than men  in many areas of health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes  Gender remains an important social determinant of health  since women s health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty  employment  and family responsibilities  Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care  and the greater the level of disadvantage  such as in developing countries  the greater adverse impact on health  Women s reproductive and sexual health places a unique burden on them  Even in developed countries pregnancy and childbirth are associated with substantial risks to women with maternal mortality accounting for more than a quarter of a million deaths per year  with large gaps between the developing and developed countries  Comorbidity from other non reproductive disease such as cardiovascular disease contribute to both the mortality and morbidity of pregnancy  including preeclampsia  Sexually transmitted infections have serious consequences for women and infants  with mother to child transmission leading to outcomes such as stillbirths and neonatal deaths  and pelvic inflammatory disease leading to infertility  In addition infertility from many other causes  birth control  unplanned pregnancy  unconsensual sexual activity and the struggle for access to abortion create other burdens for women  While the rates of the leading causes of death  cardiovascular disease  cancer and lung disease  are similar in women and men  women have different experiences  Lung cancer has overtaken all other types of cancer as the leading cause of cancer death in women  followed by breast cancer  colorectal  ovarian  uterine and cervical cancers  While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer  amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men  Despite this  breast cancer remains the commonest cancer in women in developed countries  and is one of the more important chronic diseases of women  while cervical cancer remains one of the commonest cancers in developing countries  associated with human papilloma virus  HPV   an important sexually transmitted disease  HPV vaccine together with screening offers the promise of controlling these diseases  Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease  depression  dementia  osteoporosis and anemia  A major impediment to advancing women s health has been their underrepresentation in research studies  an inequity being addressed in the United States and other western nations by the establishment of centers of excellence in women s health research and large scale clinical trials such as the Women s Health Initiative World Confederation for Physical TherapyFounded in       the World Confederation for

gatherers would have noticed several factors and certain herbal remedies would speed up or assist the process  especially if it was grievous  In ancient history  this was followed by the realisation of the necessity of hygiene and the halting of bleeding  where wound dressing techniques and surgery developed  Eventually the germ theory of disease also assisted in improving wound care
