SS  named ess    s   plural esses  is the   th letter in the Modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet       History          Origin      Northwest Semitic   n represented a voiceless postalveolar fricative      as in  ship    It originated most likely as a pictogram of a tooth       and represented the phoneme     via the acrophonic principle  Greek did not have a     phoneme  so the derived Greek letter Sigma     came to represent the voiceless alveolar sibilant  s   While the letter shape   continues Phoenician   n  its name sigma and its position in the alphabet is taken from the letter samekh  while the shape of samekh but name and position of   n is continued in the xi  Within Greek  the name of sigma was influenced by its association with the Greek word       earlier  sigj    to hiss   The original name of the letter  sigma  may have been san  but due to the complicated early history of the Greek epichoric alphabets   san  came to be identified as a separate letter     Herodotus reports that  San  was the name given by the Dorians to the same letter called  Sigma  by the Ionians  The Western Greek alphabet used in Cumae was adopted by the Etruscans and Latins in the  th century BC  over the following centuries developing into a range of Old Italic alphabets including the Etruscan alphabet and the early Latin alphabet  In Etruscan  the value  s  of Greek sigma     was maintained  while san     represented a separate phoneme  most likely      transliterated as     The early Latin alphabet adopted sigma  but not san  as Old Latin did not have a     phoneme  The shape of Latin S arises from Greek   by dropping one out of the four strokes of that letter  The  angular  S shape composed of three strokes existed as a variant of the four stroke letter   already in the epigraphy in Western Greek alphabets  and the three and four strokes variants existed alongside one another in the classical Etruscan alphabet  In other Italic alphabets  Venetic  Lepontic   the letter could be represented as a zig zagging line of any number between three and six strokes  The familiar S shape with three strokes is present in the earliest Latin inscriptions of the  th century BC  Duenos Inscription  Praeneste fibula  but with four strokes on the Garigliano Bowl   The familiar rounded S shape is present regularly in the Old Latin inscriptions of the  nd century BC  Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus   The Italic letter was also adopted into Elder Futhark  as Sowil       and appears with four to eight strokes in the earliest runic inscriptions  but is occasionally reduced to three strokes     from the later  th century  and appears regularly with three strokes in Younger Futhark        Long s      The minuscule form    called the long s  developed in the early medieval period  within the Visigothic and Carolingian hands  with predecessors in the half uncial and cursive scripts of Late Antiquity  It remained standard in western writing throughout the medieval period and was adopted in early printing with movable types  It existed alongside minuscule  round  or  short  s  which was at the time only used at the end of words  In most western orthographies  the   gradually fell out of use during the second half of the   th century  although it remained in occasional use into the   th century  In Spain  the change was mainly accomplished between the years      and       In France  the change occurred between      and       Printers in the United States stopped using the long s between      and       In English orthography  the London printer John Bell             pioneered the change  His edition of Shakespeare  in       was advertised with the claim that he  ventured to depart from the common mode by rejecting the long     in favor of the round one  as being less liable to error       The Times of London made the switch from the long to the short s with its issue of    September       Encyclopaedia Britannica s  th edition  completed in       was the last edition to use the long s  In German orthography  long s was retained in Fraktur  Schwabacher  type as well as in standard cursive  S tterlin  well into the   th century  and was officially abolished in       The ligature of  s  or  z  was retained  however  giving rise to the Eszett    in contemporary German orthography       Use in writing systems    The letter  s  is the seventh most common letter in English and the third most common consonant  after  t  and  n    It is the most common letter in starting and ending position  In English and many other languages  primarily Romance ones like Spanish and French  final  s  is the usual mark of plural nouns  It is the regular ending of English third person present tense verbs  The letter  s  represents the voiceless alveolar or voiceless dental sibilant  s  in most languages as well as in the International Phonetic Alphabet  It also commonly represents the voiced alveolar or voiced dental sibilant  z   as in Portuguese mesa  table  or English  rose  and  bands   or it may represent the voiceless palato alveolar fricative      as in most Portuguese dialects when syllable finally  in Hungarian  in German  before  p    t   and some English words as  sugar   since yod coalescence became a dominant feature  and      as in English  measure   also
