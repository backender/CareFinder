# Search Process

This section describes the ideas and setup of the search process.
In fact, this is the only component of our system with which the user will interact with.
The user will start (and end) his search on the user interface, where she/he will enter queries to be further processes and submitted to the actual search component of our information retrieval system.
Further more, the ranked results will be displayed to the user on the user interface.
