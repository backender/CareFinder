  is a diacritic used in many modern written languages with alphabets based on the Latin  Cyrillic  and Greek scripts Affricate consonantAn affricate is a consonant that begins as a stop and releases as a fricative  generally with the same place of articulation  most often coronal   It is often difficult to decide if a stop and fricative form a single phoneme or a consonant pair  English has two affricate phonemes   t    and  d     often spelled ch and j BB or b  pronounced   bi    bee  is the second letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet  It represents the voiced bilabial stop in many languages  including English  In some other languages  it is used to represent other bilabial consonants BrailleBraille   bre l   French pronunciation    b aj   is a tactile writing system used by people who are blind or visually impaired  It is traditionally written with embossed paper  Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports thanks to refreshable braille displays  They can write braille with the original slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer  such as a portable braille note taker  or on a computer that prints with a braille embosser  Braille is named after its creator  Frenchman Louis Braille  who lost his eyesight due to a childhood accident  In       at the age of     Braille developed his code for the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing  He published his system  which subsequently included musical notation  in       The second revision  published in       was the first binary form of writing developed in the modern era  Braille characters are small rectangular blocks called cells that contain tiny palpable bumps called raised dots  The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another  Since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes of printed writing systems  the mappings  sets of character designations  vary from language to language  Furthermore  in English Braille there are three levels of encoding  Grade     a letter by letter transcription used for basic literacy  Grade     an addition of abbreviations and contractions  and Grade     various non standardized personal shorthands  Braille cells are not the only thing to appear in braille text  There may be embossed illustrations and graphs  with the lines either solid or made of series of dots  arrows  bullets that are larger than braille dots  etc  A full Braille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two lateral rows each having three dots  The dot positions are identified by numbers from one through six     solutions are possible from using one or more dots  A single cell can be used to represent an alphabet letter  number  punctuation mark  or even an entire word  In the face of screen reader software  braille usage has declined  However  braille education remains important for developing reading skills among blind and visually impaired children  and braille literacy correlates with higher employment rates CC is the third letter in the English alphabet and a letter of the alphabets of many other writing systems which inherited it from the Latin alphabet  It is also the third letter of the ISO basic Latin alphabet  It is named cee  pronounced   si    in English Claudian lettersThe Claudian letters were developed by  and named after  the Roman Emperor Claudius  reigned         He introduced three new letters to the Latin alphabet    or    X  antisigma  to replace BS and PS  much as X stood in for CS and GS  The shape of this letter is disputed  however  since no inscription bearing it has been found  Franz B cheler identified it with the variant Roman numeral    but   th century philologists  working from copies of Priscian s books  believe it to instead resemble two linked Cs        which was a preexisting variant of Greek sigma  and easily mistaken for X by later writers  Revilo P  Oliver argued that Claudius would have based this letter upon the Arcadian variant of psi  or   This letter should not be confused with the  open O  letter       a turned F or digamma  digamma inversum  to represent consonantal U   w  v   The minuscule form should not be confused with the IPA symbol   representing a voiced palatal stop     a half H  The value of this letter is unclear  but perhaps it represented the so called sonus medius  a short vowel sound  likely     or      used before labial consonants in Latin words such as optumus optimus  The letter was later used as a variant of y in inscriptions for short Greek upsilon  as in Olympicus   It may have disappeared because the sonus medius itself disappeared from spoken language  These letters were used to a small extent on public inscriptions dating from Claudius  reign  but their use was abandoned after his death  Their forms were probably chosen to ease the transition  as they could be made from templates for existing letters  He may have been inspired by his ancestor Appius Claudius the Censor  who made earlier changes to the Latin alphabet  Claudius did indeed introduce his letters during his own term as censor          using arguments preserved in the historian Tacitus  account of his reign  although the original proclamation is no longer extant  Suetonius said of Claudius  letters   Besides this he  Claudius  invented three new letters and added them to the alphabet  maintaining that they were greatly needed  he published a book on their theory when he was still in private life  and when he became emperor had no difficulty in bringing about their general use  These characters may still be seen in numerous books  in the  state  registers  and in inscriptions on public buildings   The permanent change in shape from the old Roman letter    to its current closed shape P  first appears on coins from roughly the same time in Claudius  reign  Support for the letters was added in version       of Unicode  The letters are encoded as follows ClaudiusClaudius    kl  di s   Latin  Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus    August    BC      October    AD  was Roman emperor from    to     A member of the Julio Claudian dynasty  he was the son of Drusus and Antonia Minor  He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul  the first Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy  Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age  his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship  shared with his nephew Caligula in     Claudius  infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius and Caligula s reigns  potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat  His survival led to his being declared Emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula s assassination  at which point he was the last man of his family  Despite his lack of experience  Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator  He was also an ambitious builder  constructing many new roads  aqueducts  and canals across the Empire  During his reign the Empire began the conquest of Britain  if the earlier invasions of Britain by Caesar and Caligula s aborted attempts are not counted   Having a personal interest in law  he presided at public trials  and issued up to twenty edicts a day  He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign  particularly by elements of the nobility  Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position  this resulted in the deaths of many senators  These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers  though more recent historians have revised this opinion  Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife  After his death in    AD  at age of      his grand nephew and adopted son Nero succeeded him as Emperor  He was a descendant of the Octavii Rufi  through Gaius Octavius   Julii Caesares  through Julia Minor and Julia Antonia   and the Claudii Nerones  through Nero Claudius Drusus   he was a great nephew of Augustus through his full sister Octavia Minor  a nephew of Tiberius through his father Drusus  Tiberius  brother  an uncle of Caligula and finally a great uncle of Nero through Caligula s father and Nero s grandfather Germanicus  his brother Coptic alphabetThe Coptic alphabet is the script used for writing the Coptic language  The repertoire of glyphs is based on the Greek alphabet augmented by letters borrowed from the Egyptian Demotic and is the first alphabetic script used for the Egyptian language  There are several Coptic alphabets  as the Coptic writing system may vary greatly among the various dialects and subdialects of the Coptic language Cyrillic scriptThe Cyrillic script  s  r l k  is a writing system used for various alphabets across eastern Europe and north and central Asia  It is based on the Early Cyrillic  which was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the  th century AD at the Preslav Literary School  It is the basis of alphabets used in various languages  past and present  in parts of southeastern Europe and northern Eurasia  especially those of Slavic origin  and non Slavic languages influenced by Russian  As of       around     million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages  with Russia accounting for about half of them  With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on   January       Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union  following the Latin script and Greek script  Cyrillic is derived from the Greek uncial script  augmented by letters from the older Glagolitic alphabet  including some ligatures  These additional letters were used for Old Church Slavonic sounds not found in Greek  The script is named in honor of the two Byzantine brothers  Saints Cyril and Methodius  who created the Glagolitic alphabet earlier on  Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by early disciples of Cyril and Methodius  In the early   th century the Cyrillic script used in Russia was heavily reformed by Peter the Great  who had recently returned from his Grand Embassy in western Europe  The new form of letters became closer to the Latin alphabet  several archaic letters were removed and several letters were personally designed by Peter the Great  such as   which was inspired by Latin R   West European typography culture was also adopted DD  named dee   di    is the fourth letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet DiacriticA diacritic   also diacritical mark  diacritical point  or diacritical sign   is a glyph added to a letter  or basic glyph  The term derives from the Ancient Greek              diakritik s   distinguishing    from           diakr  n    to distinguish    Diacritic is primarily an adjective  though sometimes used as a noun  whereas diacritical is only ever an adjective  Some diacritical marks  such as the acute       and grave        are often called accents  Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter  or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters  The main use of diacritical marks in the Latin script is to change the sound values of the letters to which they are added  Examples from English are the diaereses in na ve and No l  which show that the vowel with the diaeresis mark is pronounced separately from the preceding vowel  the acute and grave accents  which can indicate that a final vowel is to be pronounced  as in sak  and poetic breath d  and the cedilla under the  c  in the borrowed French word fa ade  which shows it is pronounced  s  rather than  k   In other Latin alphabets  they may distinguish between homonyms  such as the French l    there   versus la   the   that are both pronounced  la   In Gaelic type  a dot over a consonant indicates lenition of the consonant in question  In other alphabetic systems  diacritical marks may perform other functions  Vowel pointing systems  namely the Arabic harakat               etc   and the Hebrew niqqud                       etc   systems  indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet  The Indic virama     etc   and the Arabic suk n         mark the absence of a vowel  Cantillation marks indicate prosody  Other uses include the Early Cyrillic titlo        and the Hebrew gershayim        which  respectively  mark abbreviations or acronyms  and Greek diacritical marks  which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as numerals  In the Hanyu Pinyin official romanization system for Chinese  diacritics are used to mark the tones of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur  In orthography and collation  a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new  distinct letter or as a letter diacritic combination  This varies from language to language  and may vary from case to case within a language  In some cases  letters are used as  in line diacritics   with the same function as ancillary glyphs  in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them  as in the case of the  h  in the English pronunciation of  sh  and  th  Dot  diacritic When used as a diacritic mark  the term dot is usually reserved for the Interpunct        or to the glyphs  combining dot above         and  combining dot below         which may be combined with some letters of the extended Latin

an uppercase and a lowercase form    the exact same letters that are found in the ISO basic Latin alphabet   The exact shape of printed letters varies depending on the typeface  nowadays commonly referred to as a font   The shape of handwritten letters can differ significantly from the standard printed form  and between individuals   especially when written in cursive style  See the individual letter articles for information about letter shapes and origins  follow the links on any of the uppercase letters above   Written English uses    digraphs  such as ch  sh  th  ph  wh  etc   but they are not considered separate letters of the alphabet  Some traditions also use two ligatures    and    or consider the ampersand     part of the alphabet English orthographyEnglish orthography is the system of writing conventions used to represent spoken English in written form that allows readers to connect spelling to sound to meaning  Like the orthography of most world languages  English has a broad degree of standardization  However  unlike most languages  there are multiple ways to spell nearly every phoneme  sound   and also most letters have multiple pronunciations depending on their position in a word and the context  Several orthographic mistakes are common even among native speakers  This is mainly due to the large number of words that have been borrowed from a large number of other languages throughout the history of the English language  without successful attempts at complete spelling reforms  Most of the spelling conventions in Modern English were derived from the phonetic spelling of a variety of Middle English  and generally do not reflect the sound changes that have occurred since the late   th century  such as the Great Vowel Shift   Despite the various English dialects spoken from country to country and within different regions of the same country  there are only slight regional variations in English orthography  the two most recognized variations being British and American spelling  and its overall uniformity helps facilitate international communication  On the other hand  it also adds to the discrepancy between the way English is written and spoken in any given location FF  named ef    f   is the sixth letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet Flag semaphoreFlag semaphore  from the Greek       sema  meaning sign and       phero  meaning to bear  altogether the sign bearer  is the telegraphy system conveying information at a distance by means of visual signals with hand held flags  rods  disks  paddles  or occasionally bare or gloved hands  Information is encoded by the position of the flags  it is read when the flag is in a fixed position  Semaphores were adopted and widely used  with hand held flags replacing the mechanical arms of shutter semaphores  in the maritime world in the   th century  It is still used during underway replenishment at sea and is acceptable for emergency communication in daylight or  using lighted wands instead of flags  at night GG  named gee   d i    is the  th letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet Germanic languagesThe Germanic languages are a branch of the Indo European language family spoken natively by a population of approximately     million people mainly in North America  Oceania  Southern Africa  and Central  Western and Northern Europe  It is the third most spoken Indo European subdivision  behind Italic and Indo Iranian  and ahead of Balto Slavic languages  The West Germanic branch includes the three most widely spoken Germanic languages  English with approximately         million native speakers  German with over     million native speakers  and Dutch with    million native speakers  Other major West Germanic languages are Afrikaans an offshoot of Dutch with over     million native speakers  Low German with roughly     million native speakers  considered a separate collection of dialects    million in Germany and     million in the Netherlands   Yiddish once used by approximately    million Jews in pre World War II Europe  and Scots  both with     million native speakers  Limburgish varieties have roughly     million speakers along the Dutch Belgian German border  The main North Germanic languages are Norwegian  Danish  Swedish  Icelandic  and Faroese  which have a combined total of about    million speakers  The East Germanic branch included Gothic  Burgundian  and Vandalic  all of which are now extinct  The last to die off was Crimean Gothic  spoken in the late   th century in some isolated areas of Crimea  The SIL Ethnologue lists    different living Germanic languages  of which    belong to the Western branch  and   to the Northern branch  they place Hunsrik language in neither of the categories  though it is often considered a dialect of the German language by linguists  The total number of Germanic languages throughout history is unknown  as some of them especially East Germanic languages disappeared during or after the Migration Period  The common ancestor of all of the languages in this branch is called Proto Germanic also known as Common Germanic which was spoken in approximately the middle  st millennium BC in Iron Age Scandinavia  Proto Germanic  along with all of its descendants  is characterized by a number of unique linguistic features  most famously the consonant change known as Grimm s law  Early varieties of Germanic enter history with the Germanic tribes moving south from Scandinavia in the  nd century BC  to settle in the area of today s northern Germany and southern Denmark Gothic alphabetThe Gothic alphabet is an alphabet for writing the Gothic language  created in the  th century by Ulfilas  or Wulfila  for the purpose of translating the Bible  The alphabet is essentially a uncial form of the Greek alphabet  with a few additional letters to account for Gothic phonology  Latin F and G  a questionably Runic letter to distinguish the  w  glide from vocalic  u   and the letter  air to express the Gothic labiovelar  It is completely different from the  Gothic script  of the Middle Ages  a script used to write the Latin alphabet Greek alphabetThe Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late  th century BC or early  th century BC It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet  and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants  It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts  Apart from its use in writing the Greek language  in both its ancient and its modern forms  the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics  science and other fields  In its classical and modern forms  the alphabet has    letters  ordered from alpha to omega  Like Latin and Cyrillic  Greek originally had only a single form of each letter  it developed the letter case distinction between upper case and lower case forms in parallel with Latin during the modern era  Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek usage  because the pronunciation of Greek has changed significantly between the  th century BC and today  Modern and Ancient Greek use different diacritics  The traditional orthography  which is used for Ancient Greek and sometimes for Modern Greek  has many diacritics  such as accent marks for pitch accent   polytonic    the breathing marks for the presence and absence of the initial  h  sound  and the iota subscript for the final historical  i  sound  In standard Modern Greek spelling  orthography has been simplified to the monotonic system  which uses only two diacritics  the acute accent and diaeresis Greek languageGreek  Modern Greek            elini ka   ellinik    Greek                    elini ci   losa   ellinik  gl ssa   Greek language   is an independent branch of the Indo European family of languages  native to Greece and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean  It has the longest documented history of any living language  spanning    centuries of written records  Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history  other systems  such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary  were used previously  The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin  Cyrillic  Armenian  Coptic  Gothic and many other writing systems  The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity  the canon of ancient Greek literature includes seminal works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey  Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science  especially astronomy  mathematics and logic  and Western philosophy  such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle  are composed  the New Testament of the Holy Bible was written in Koin  Greek  Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world  the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics  During antiquity  Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and beyond  It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek  In its modern form  the Greek language is the official language in two countries  Greece and Cyprus  a recognised minority language in seven other countries  and is one of the    official languages of the European Union  The language is spoken by at least    million people today in Greece  Cyprus  Italy  Albania  Turkey  and the Greek diaspora  Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages  Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary Grimm s lawGrimm s law  also known as the First Germanic Sound Shift or Rask s rule  is a set of statements named after Jacob Grimm describing the inherited Proto Indo European  PIE  stop consonants as they developed in Proto Germanic  the common ancestor of the Germanic branch of the Indo European family  in the  st millennium BC  It establishes a set of regular correspondences between early Germanic stops and fricatives and the stop consonants of certain other centum Indo European languages  Grimm used mostly Latin and Greek for illustration  HH  named aitch   e t   or also haitch   he t   plural aitches or haitches  is the eighth letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet History of the Latin alphabetThe Latin alphabet is the most widely used alphabetic writing system in the world  It is the standard script of the English language and is often referred to simply as  the alphabet  in English  It is a true alphabet which originated in the  th century BC in Italy and has changed continually over the last      years  It has roots in the Semitic alphabet and its offshoot alphabets  the Phoenician  Greek  and Etruscan  The phonetic values of some letters changed  some letters were lost and gained  and several writing styles   hands   developed  Two such styles  the minuscule and majuscule hands  were combined into one script with alternate forms for the lower and upper case letters  Due to classicism  modern uppercase letters differ only slightly from their classical counterparts  There are few regional variants II  named i   a    plural ies  is the ninth letter and the third vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet NATO phonetic alphabetThe International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet  commonly known as the ICAO phonetic alphabet  sometimes called the NATO alphabet or spelling alphabet and the ITU radiotelephonic or phonetic alphabet  is the most widely used radiotelephonic spelling alphabet  Although often called  phonetic alphabets   spelling alphabets are not associated with phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet  Instead  the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet  so that critical combinations of letters and numbers can be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of language barriers or the quality of the communication channel  The    code words in the NATO phonetic alphabet are assigned to the    letters of the English alphabet in alphabetical order as follows  Alfa  Bravo  Charlie  Delta  Echo  Foxtrot  Golf  Hotel  India  Juliett  Kilo  Lima

International Phonetic Alphabet  IPA  is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin alphabet  It was devised by the International Phonetic Association as a standardized representation of the sounds of spoken language  The IPA is used by lexicographers  foreign language students and teachers  linguists  speech language pathologists  singers  actors  constructed language creators  and translators  The IPA is designed to represent only those qualities of speech that are part of oral language  phones  phonemes  intonation  and the separation of words and syllables  To represent additional qualities of speech  such as tooth gnashing  lisping  and sounds made with a cleft lip and cleft palate  an extended set of symbols  the extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet  may be used  IPA symbols are composed of one or more elements of two basic types  letters and diacritics  For example  the sound of the English letter  t  may be transcribed in IPA with a single letter   t   or with a letter plus diacritics   t     depending on how precise one wishes to be  Often  slashes are used to signal broad or phonemic transcription  thus   t  is less specific than  and could refer to  either  t    or  t   depending on the context and language  Occasionally letters or diacritics are added  removed  or modified by the International Phonetic Association  As of the most recent change in       there are     letters     diacritics  and four prosodic marks in the IPA  These are shown in the current IPA chart  posted below in this

usually represents the voiceless velar plosive Kluge s lawKluge s law is a controversial Proto Germanic sound law formulated by Friedrich Kluge  It purports to explain the origin of the Proto Germanic long consonants  kk   tt  and  pp  Proto Indo European lacked a phonemic length distinction for consonants  as originating in the assimilation of  n to a preceding voiced plosive consonant  under the condition that the  n was part of a suffix which was stressed in the ancestral Proto Indo European  PIE   The name  Kluge s law  was coined by Kauffmann        and revived by Frederik Kortlandt         As of       this law has not been generally accepted by historical linguists  The resulting long consonants would subsequently have been shortened  except when they followed a short vowel  this is uncontroversial for  ss  which has a different origin   Proponents of Kluge s law use this to explain why so many Proto Germanic roots  especially of strong verbs  end in short  p   t or  k even though their likely cognates in other Indo European languages point to final Proto Indo European  PIE  consonants other than the expected  b   d   g or      Indeed  non Germanic evidence for PIE  b is so rare that  b may not have been a phoneme at all  yet  in Proto Germanic   p was only rare at the beginnings of words   Much like Verner s law  Kluge s law would have created many consonant alternations in the grammatical paradigm of a word that were soon only partially predictable anymore  Analogical simplifications of these complexities are proposed as an explanation for the many cases where closely related  often otherwise identical  words point to short  long  plosive  fricative  voiceless or voiced Proto Germanic consonants in closely related Germanic languages or dialects  even sometimes the same dialect LL  named el   l   is the twelfth letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet  used in words such as lagoon  lantern  and less Latin alphabetsA Latin or Roman alphabet is one of many alphabets that use the letters of the Latin script  These letters formed the basis of the original Roman Latin alphabet  Some letters of the Latin script were altered slightly for use in particular languages  although the main letters are largely the same  There were several general types of alterations made to extend the alphabet s uses  depending on the language  diacritics could be added to existing letters  two letters could be fused together into ligatures  additional letters could be inserted  or pairs or triplets of letters could be treated as units  digraphs and trigraphs   Any additional letters were often given a place in the alphabet by defining an alphabetical order or collation sequence  which can vary between languages  Some of the additions  especially letters which only have diacritics added to them  were not considered distinct letters for this purpose  For example  the French   and the German    are not listed separately in their respective alphabet sequences  In some languages  digraphs are included in the collation sequence  e g  Hungarian CS  Welsh RH   The ISO basic Latin alphabet includes the    basic letters that are included in most alphabets  The International Phonetic Alphabet is also derived mainly from the Latin script  The tables below summarize and compare some of the alphabets  In this article  the

definition of a Latin script letter for this list is a character encoded in the Unicode Standard that has a script property of  Latin  and the general category of  Letter   An overview of the distribution of Latin script letters in Unicode is given in Latin script in Unicode List of emoticonsThis is a list of notable and commonly used emoticons or textual portrayals of a writer s moods or facial expressions in the form of icons  The Western use of emoticons is quite different from Eastern usage  and Internet forums  such as  channel  typically show expressions in their own ways  In recent times  graphic representations  both static and animated  have taken the place of traditional emoticons in the form of icons  These are commonly known as emoji although the term kaomoji is more correct  Emoticons can generally be divided into three groups  Western or horizontal  mainly from America and Europe   Eastern or vertical  mainly from east Asia   and  channel style  originally used on  channel and other Japanese message boards   The most common explanation for these differences is how the different cultures use different parts of the face to express emotions  i e  eyes often play a bigger role in the East while the whole face is used more in the West MM  named em    m   is the thirteenth letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet Mind your Ps and QsMind your Ps and Qs is an English expression meaning  mind your manners    mind your language    be on your best behaviour  or similar  Attempts at explaining the origin of the phrase go back to the mid   th century  One explanation favoured in a letter to the editors of Notes and Queries dated       as well as by the Oxford English Dictionary upon their revision of the relevant entry in       is literal interpretation of the saying  concerning the distinction of the lowercase letters p and q in the context of the school room or the printing office  As noted by W  D  Henkle in Educational Notes and Queries in       in this case the proper spelling of the phrase should be  note your p s and q s   because the distinction of majuscule P and Q does not pose a problem  Nevertheless  a number of alternative explanations have been considered as more or less plausible  Another explanation suggests that  Ps and Qs  is short for  pleases  and  thank yous   the latter of which contains a sound similar to the pronunciation of the name of the letter  Q   Another proposed origin is from the English pubs and taverns of the   th century  Bartenders would keep a watch on the alcohol consumption of the patrons  keeping an eye on the pints and quarts that were consumed  As a reminder to the patrons  the bartender would recommend they  mind their Ps and Qs   This may also have been a reminder to bartenders not to confuse the two units  written as  p  and  q  on the tally slate  Other origin stories  some considered  fanciful   could come from French instructions to mind one s pieds  feet  and queues  wigs  while dancing  However  there is no French translation for this expression  Another origin could be from sailors in the   th century who were reminded to pay attention to their peas  pea coat  and queues  pony tail   Another proposal concerns the use of Norman French in medieval England  as the English dialect of the   th century had no qs  one must watch their usage in court or discourse with the French Norman conquerors   Quinion cites an apparently related expression of pee and kew for  highest quality  used in   th century English Morse codeMorse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on off tones  lights  or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment  It is named for Samuel F  B  Morse  an inventor of the telegraph  The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet  some extra Latin letters  the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals  prosigns  as standardized sequences of short and long signals called  dots  and  dashes   or  dits  and  dahs   as in amateur radio practice  Because many non English natural languages use more than the    Roman letters  extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages  Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character  letter or numeral  or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes  The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot  Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence  equal to the dot duration  The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots  one dash   and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots  The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission  To increase the speed of the communication  the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse varies approximately inversely to its frequency of occurrence in English  Thus the most common letter in English  the letter  E   has the shortest code  a single dot  Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators  although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing in most countries  Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding  Aeronautical navigational aids  such as VORs and NDBs  constantly identify in Morse code  Compared to voice  Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions  yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device  Morse is  therefore  a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels  Many amateur radio repeaters  for example  identify with Morse  even though they are used for voice communications   In an emergency  Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily  keyed  on and off  making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication  The most common distress signal is SOS or three dots  three dashes  and three dots  internationally recognized by treaty NN  named en    n   is the   th letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet Numeric character referenceA numeric character reference  NCR  is a common markup construct used in SGML and SGML derived markup languages such as HTML and XML  It consists of a short sequence of characters that  in turn  represents a single character  Since WebSgml  XML and HTML    the code points of the Universal Character Set  UCS  of Unicode are used  NCRs are typically used in order to represent characters that are not directly encodable in a particular document  for example  because they are international characters that don t fit in the   bit character set being used  or because they have special syntactic meaning in the language   When the document is interpreted by a markup aware reader  each NCR is treated as if it were the character it represents OO  named o   o    plural oes  is the   th letter and the second to last vowel in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet Old Italic scriptOld Italic is one of several now extinct alphabet systems used on the Italian Peninsula in ancient times for various Indo European languages  predominantly Italic  and non Indo European  e g  Etruscan  languages  The alphabets derive from the Euboean Greek Cumaean alphabet  used at Ischia and Cumae in the Bay of Naples in the eighth century BC  Various Indo European languages belonging to the Italic branch  Faliscan and members of the Sabellian group  including Oscan  Umbrian  and South Picene  and other Indo European branches such as Celtic  Venetic and Messapic  originally used the alphabet  Faliscan  Oscan  Umbrian  North Picene  and South Picene all derive from an Etruscan form of the alphabet  The Germanic runic alphabet was derived from one of these alphabets by the  nd century AD Old LatinOld Latin  also known as Early Latin or Archaic Latin  refers to the Latin language in the period before    BC  before the age of Classical Latin  In New and Contemporary Latin  it is called prisca Latinitas   ancient Latin   rather than vetus Latina   old Latin    as vetus Latina is used to refer to a set of Biblical texts  The use of  old    early  and  archaic  has been standard in publications of Old Latin writings since at least the   th century  The definition is not arbitrary  but the terms refer to writings with spelling conventions and word forms not generally found in works written under the Roman Empire  This article presents some of the major differences  The earliest known specimen of the Latin language is from the Praeneste fibula  A new analysis performed in      declared it to be genuine  beyond any reasonable doubt  and dating from the Orientalizing period  in the first half of the seventh century BC P SharpP  is a Prolog interpreter written for the Common Language Infrastructure  Features  Languages extensions allow concurrency in Prolog  Prolog programs can create any  NET object  Compatible with Microsoft  NET Framework and Mono P with stroke   minuscule     or  p with stroke  is a letter of the Latin alphabet  formed from P with the addition of a stroke  usually through the bowl but sometimes through the descender  It is used in some phonetic transcription systems  such as the Americanist phonetic notation  to represent a fricative      In        was adopted for writing the Tanimuca Retuar  language  where it represents either a fricative or a stop depending on the dialect PalaeographyPalaeography  UK  or paleography  US  ultimately from Greek           palai s   old   and          graphein   to write   is the study of ancient and historical handwriting  that is to say  of the forms and processes of writing  not the textual content of documents   Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering  reading  and dating historical manuscripts  and the cultural context of writing  including the methods with which writing and books were produced  and the history of scriptoria  The discipline is important for understanding  authenticating  and dating ancient texts  However  it cannot in general be used to pinpoint dates with high precision Pe  Cyrillic Pe       italics       is a letter of the Cyrillic script  It commonly represents the unaspirated voiceless bilabial plosive  p   like the pronunciation of  p  in  spin  Pe  letter Pe is the seventeenth letter of the Semitic abjads  including Phoenician P    Hebrew P     Aramaic P    Syriac P     and Arabic F      in abjadi order  and also Persian Pe     The original sound value is a voiceless bilabial plosive   p   it retains this value in most Semitic languages except for Arabic  which having lost  p  now uses it to render a voiceless labiodental fricative  f   The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Pi      Latin P  and Cyrillic   PeacePeace occurs between heterogeneous social groups and is characterized by a lack of conflict and freedom from fear of violence  Leaders throughout history have established periods of regional peace through peace treaties that have resulted from bilateral and multilateral peace talks  Commonly understood as the absence of hostility  peace often involves compromise  and therefore is initiated with thoughtful listening and communication to enhance and create mutual understanding  Peace can be defined in a positive direction and in a negative sense  Positively  peace is a state of tranquility and stillness  however  in a negative sense  peace is the absence of war or violence PhiPhi  uppercase    lowercase  or   Ancient Greek       phe    p   e   modern Greek      fi   fi   English   fa    is the   st letter of the Greek alphabet  In Ancient Greek  it represented an aspirated voiceless bilabial plosive   p     which was the origin of its usual romanization as  ph   In modern Greek  it represents a voiceless labiodental fricative   f   and is correspondingly romanized as  f   Its origin is uncertain but it may be that phi originated as the letter qoppa and initially represented the sound  k    before shifting to Classical Greek  p    In traditional Greek numerals  phi has a value of          or               The Cyrillic letter Ef        descends from phi  Phi is also used as a symbol for the golden ratio and on other occasions in math and science  This use is separately encoded as the Unicode glyph    The modern Greek pronunciation of the letter is sometimes encountered in English  as  fi    when the letter is being used in this sense Philippine peso signThe Philippine peso sign     is the currency sign used for the Philippine peso  the official currency of the Philippines  The symbol resembles a Latin letter P with a double stroke  This insignia of the Philippine peso is native to the Philippines  while the other countries having peso as the main currency use the peso sign  also known as dollar sign  as their symbol Phoenician alphabetThe Phoenician alphabet  called by convention the Proto Canaanite alphabet for inscriptions older than around      BC  is the oldest verified alphabet  The Phoenician alphabet is an abjad consisting of    letters  all consonants  with matres lectionis used for some vowels in certain late varieties  It was used for the writing of Phoenician  a Northern Semitic language  used by the civilization of Phoenicia  Some think that the Phoenician alphabet is derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs  It became one of the most widely used writing systems  spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world  where it evolved and was assimilated by many other cultures  The Paleo Hebrew alphabet was directly derived from Phoenician  Another derivative script is the Aramaic alphabet  which was the ancestor of the modern Arabic script  The Modern Hebrew script is a stylistic variant of the Aramaic script  The Greek alphabet  and by extension its descendants  such as Latin  Cyrillic  Runic  and Coptic  was also derived from Phoenician  As the letters were originally incised with a stylus  most of the shapes are angular and straight  although more cursive versions are increasingly attested in later times  culminating in the Neo Punic alphabet of Roman era North Africa  Phoenician was usually written from right to left  although there are some texts written in boustrophedon PhonemeA phoneme    fo ni m   is one of the units of sound  or gesture in the case of sign languages  see chereme  that distinguish one word from another in a particular language  The difference in meaning between the English words kill and kiss is a result of the exchange of the phoneme  l  for the phoneme  s   Two words that differ in meaning through a contrast of a single phoneme form a minimal pair  In linguistics  phonemes  usually established by the use of minimal pairs  such as kill vs kiss or pat vs bat  are written between slashes like this   p   whereas when it is desired to show the more exact pronunciation of any sound  linguists use square brackets  for example  p    indicating an aspirated p   Within linguistics there are differing views as to exactly what phonemes are and how a given language should be analyzed in phonemic  or phonematic  terms  However  a phoneme is generally regarded as an abstraction of a set  or equivalence class  of speech sounds  phones  which are perceived as equivalent to each other in a given language  For example  in English  the k sounds in the words kit and skill are not identical  as described below   but they are distributional variants of a single phoneme  k   Different speech sounds that are realizations of the same phoneme are known as allophones  Allophonic variation may be conditioned  in which case a certain phoneme is realized as a certain allophone in particular phonological environments  or it may be free in which case it may vary randomly  In this way  phonemes are often considered to constitute an abstract underlying representation for segments of words  while speech sounds make up the corresponding phonetic realization  or surface form Pi  letter Pi    pa    Greek   pi   uppercase    lowercase    is the sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet  representing  p   In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of     It was derived from the Phoenician letter Pe     Letters that arose from pi include Cyrillic Pe         Coptic pi         and Gothic pairthra     PlutoPluto  minor planet designation         Pluto  is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt  a ring of bodies beyond Neptune  It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered  Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in      and was originally considered to be the ninth planet from the Sun  After       its planethood was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt  In       Eris  which is     more massive than Pluto  was discovered  This led the International Astronomical Union  IAU  to define the term  planet  formally in       during their   th General Assembly  That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet  Pluto is the largest and second most massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System and the ninth largest and tenth most massive known object directly orbiting the Sun  It is the largest known trans Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris  a dwarf planet in the scattered disc  Like other Kuiper belt objects  Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small about one sixth the mass of the Moon and one third its volume  It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from    to    astronomical units or AU          billion km  from the Sun  This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune  but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding  Light from the Sun takes about     hours to reach Pluto at its average distance       AU   Pluto has five known moons  Charon  the largest  with a diameter just over half that of Pluto   Styx  Nix  Kerberos  and Hydra  Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body  The IAU has not formalized a definition for binary dwarf planets  and Charon is officially classified as a moon of Pluto  In September       astronomers announced that the reddish brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins  organic macromolecules that may be ingredients for the emergence of life  and produced from methane  nitrogen and related gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred over about        km         mi  distance to the orbiting moon  On July           the New Horizons spacecraft became the first spacecraft to fly by Pluto  During its brief flyby  New Horizons made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons  On October           at       pm ET  the last bit of data  of a total of    billion bits of data  or      gigabytes  was received from New Horizons from its close encounter with Pluto on July          Proto Indo European phonologyThe phonology of the Proto Indo European language  PIE  has been reconstructed by linguists  based on the similarities and differences among current and extinct Indo European languages  Because PIE was not written  linguists must rely on the evidence of its earliest attested descendants  such as Hittite  Sanskrit  Ancient Greek and Latin  to reconstruct its phonology  The reconstruction of abstract units of PIE phonological systems  i e  segments  or phonemes in traditional phonology  is mostly fairly uncontroversial  although areas of dispute remain  Their phonetic interpretation is more difficult to establish  this pertains especially to the vowels  the so called laryngeals  and the voiced stops PunctuationPunctuation is the use of spacing  conventional signs  and certain typographical devices as aids to the understanding and the correct reading  both silently and aloud  of handwritten and printed texts  Another description is   The practice  action  or system of inserting points or other small marks into texts  in order to aid interpretation  division of text into sentences  clauses  etc   by means of such marks   In written English  punctuation is vital to disambiguate the meaning of sentences  For example   woman  without her man  is nothing   emphasizing the importance of men   and  woman  without her  man is nothing   emphasizing the importance of women  have very different meanings  as do  eats shoots and leaves   which means the subject consumes plant growths  and  eats  shoots  and leaves   which means the subject eats first  then fires a weapon  and then leaves the scene   The sharp differences in meaning are produced by the simple differences in punctuation within the example pairs  especially the latter  The rules of punctuation vary with language  location  register and time and are constantly evolving  Certain aspects of punctuation are stylistic and are thus the author s  or editor s  choice  or tachygraphic language forms  such as those used in online chat and text messages P P   majuscule  P   minuscule  p   is a Latin P with a diacritical tilde  It is or was used as a grapheme in some languages of Vanuatu  such as North Efate  South Efate and Namakura  to represent a  k p   It is also used in the Yanesha language  The letter was introduced by missionaries and has been in use for over a hundred years  In Bislama  the lingua franca of Vanuatu  p with tilde is called snekpi  snake P   In Old English  it was used as a contraction of the penny  as in  cxx  p         pence   QQ  named cue   kju    is the   th letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet  In nearly all languages using the Latin alphabet it is a consonant  not a vowel RR  named ar or    r   is the   th letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet RhoRho    ro    uppercase    lowercase   or    Greek      is the   th letter of the Greek alphabet  In the system of Greek numerals  it has a value of      It is derived from Phoenician letter res   Its uppercase form is not to be confused with the Latin letter P  although both types use the same glyph  P Roman numeralsThe numeric system represented by Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages  Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet  Roman numerals  as used today  are based on seven symbols   The use of Roman numerals continued long after the decline of the Roman Empire  From the   th century on  Roman numerals began to be replaced in most contexts by the more convenient Hindu Arabic numerals  however  this process was gradual  and the use of Roman numerals persists in some minor applications to this day SS  named ess    s   plural esses  is the   th letter in the Modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet TT  named tee   ti    is the   th letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet  It is the most commonly used consonant and the second most common letter in English language texts TildeThe tilde    t ld      or    is a grapheme with several uses  The name of the character came into English from Spanish  which in turn came from the Latin titulus  meaning  title  or  superscription   The reason for the name was that it was originally written over a letter as a scribal abbreviation  as a  mark of suspension   shown as a straight line when used with capitals  Thus the commonly used words Anno Domini were frequently abbreviated to Ao D i  an elevated terminal with a suspension mark placed over the  n   Such a mark could denote the omission of one letter or several letters  This saved on the expense of the scribe s labour and the cost of vellum and ink  Medieval European charters written in Latin are largely made up of such abbreviated words with suspension marks and other abbreviations  only uncommon words were given in full  The tilde has since been applied to a number of other uses as a diacritic mark or a character in its own right  These are encoded in Unicode at U         Combining Tilde and U    E   Tilde  as a spacing character   and there are additional similar characters for different roles  In lexicography  the latter kind of tilde and the swung dash     are used in dictionaries to indicate the omission of the entry word UU  named u   ju    plural ues  is the   st letter and the fifth vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet UTF  UTF   is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters  or code points  defined by Unicode and originally designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike  The encoding is variable length and uses   bit code units  It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII and to avoid the complications of endianness and byte order marks in the alternative UTF    and UTF    encodings  The name is derived from Unicode  or Universal Coded Character Set  Transformation Format      bit   UTF   is the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web  accounting for       of all Web pages in March       the most popular East Asian encodings  Shift JIS and GB       have      and      respectively   The Internet Mail Consortium  IMC  recommended that all e mail programs be able to display and create mail using UTF    and the W C recommends UTF   as the default encoding in XML and HTML  UTF   encodes each of the           valid code points in Unicode using one to four   bit bytes  Code points with lower numerical values  which tend to occur more frequently  are encoded using fewer bytes  The first     characters of Unicode  which correspond one to one with ASCII  are encoded using a single octet with the same binary value as ASCII  so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF   encoded Unicode as well  Since ASCII bytes do not occur when encoding non ASCII code points into UTF    UTF   is safe to use within most programming and document languages that interpret certain ASCII characters in a special way  such as     in filenames and     in printf UnicodeUnicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding  representation  and handling of text expressed in most of the world s writing systems  Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set  UCS  standard and published as The Unicode Standard  the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than         characters covering     modern and historic scripts  as well as multiple symbol sets  The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference  an encoding method and set of standard character encodings  a set of reference data files  and a number of related items  such as character properties  rules for normalization  decomposition  collation  rendering  and bidirectional display order  for the correct display of text containing both right to left scripts  such as Arabic and Hebrew  and left to right scripts   As of June       the most recent version is Unicode      The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium  Unicode s success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread and predominant use in the internationalization and localization of computer software  The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies  including modern operating systems  XML  Java  and other programming languages   and the  NET Framework  Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings  The most commonly used encodings are UTF    UTF    and the now obsolete UCS    UTF   uses one byte for any ASCII character  all of which have the same code values in both UTF   and ASCII encoding  and up to four bytes for other characters  UCS   uses a    bit code unit  two   bit bytes  for each character but cannot encode every character in the current Unicode standard  UTF    extends UCS    using one    bit unit for the characters that were representable in UCS   and two    bit units        bits  to handle each of the additional characters VV  named vee   vi     is the   nd letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet Voiceless bilabial stopThe voiceless bilabial stop is a type of consonantal sound used in many spoken languages  The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is  p

joined to the bottom right side of a letter  and is distinguished from various other hooks indicating retroflexion  etc  The IPA recommended that esh       and ezh     not use the palatal hook  but instead get special curled symbols    and    However  versions with the hook may have been used by some authors  The palatal hook was withdrawn by the IPA in       in favour of a superscript j

acute accent       is a diacritic used in many modern written languages with alphabets based on the Latin  Cyrillic  and Greek scripts Dot  diacritic When used as a diacritic mark  the term dot is usually reserved for the Interpunct        or to the glyphs  combining dot above         and  combining dot below         which may be combined with some letters of the extended Latin alphabets in use in Central European languages and Vietnamese Sound recording copyright symbolThe sound recording copyright symbol  represented by the graphic symbol    a circled capital letter P   is the copyright symbol used to provide notice of copyright in a sound recording  phonogram  embodied in a phonorecord  LPs  audiotapes  cassettes  compact discs  etc    Present in Europe since at least the mid     s  the use of the symbol in United States copyright law after      was codified at    U S C  and is specified internationally in the Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms  The P stands for phonogram  the legal term used in most English speaking countries to refer to works known in U S  copyright law as  sound recordings   A sound recording has a separate copyright that is distinct from that of the underlying work  usually a musical work  expressible in musical notation and written lyrics   if any  The sound recording
