visually impaired  It is traditionally written with embossed paper  Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports thanks to refreshable braille displays  They can write braille with the original slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer  such as a portable braille note taker  or on a computer that prints with a braille embosser  Braille is named after its creator  Frenchman Louis Braille  who lost his eyesight due to a childhood accident  In       at the age of     Braille developed his code for the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing  He published his system  which subsequently included musical notation  in       The second revision  published in       was the first binary form of writing developed in the modern era  Braille characters are small rectangular blocks called cells that contain tiny palpable bumps called raised dots  The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another  Since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes of printed writing systems  the mappings  sets of character designations  vary from language to language  Furthermore  in English Braille there are three levels of encoding  Grade     a letter by letter transcription used for basic literacy  Grade     an addition of abbreviations and contractions  and Grade     various non standardized personal shorthands  Braille cells are not the only thing to appear in braille text  There may be embossed illustrations and graphs  with the lines either solid or made of series of dots  arrows  bullets that are larger than braille dots  etc  A full Braille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two lateral rows each having three dots  The dot positions are identified by numbers from one through six     solutions are possible from using one or more dots  A single cell can be used to represent an alphabet letter  number  punctuation mark  or even an entire word  In the face of screen reader software  braille usage has declined  However  braille education remains important for developing reading skills among blind and visually impaired children  and braille literacy correlates with higher employment rates Braille pattern dots   The Braille pattern dots          is a   dot braille cell with the top left and middle right dots raised  or an   dot braille cell with the top left and

vowelThe close mid central unrounded vowel  or high mid central unrounded vowel  is a type of vowel sound  used in some spoken languages  The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is      This is a mirrored letter e  and should not be confused with the schwa      which is a turned e  It was added to the IPA in       before that  this vowel was transcribed      Latin small letter e with umlaut  not Cyrillic small letter yo   Certain older sources transcribe this vowel       The     letter may be used with a lowering diacritic       to denote the mid central unrounded vowel  The IPA prefers terms  close  and  open  for vowels  and the name of the article follows this  However  a large number of linguists  perhaps a majority  prefer the terms  high

used for writing the Coptic language  The repertoire of glyphs is based on the Greek alphabet augmented by letters borrowed from the Egyptian Demotic and is the first alphabetic script used for the Egyptian language  There are several Coptic alphabets  as the Coptic writing system may vary greatly among the various dialects and subdialects of the Coptic language CryptographyCryptography or cryptology  from Greek         krypt s   hidden  secret   and         graphein   writing   or         logia   study   respectively  is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries  More generally  cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages  various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality  data integrity  authentication  and non repudiation are central to modern cryptography  Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics  computer science  and electrical engineering  Applications of cryptography include ATM cards  computer passwords  and electronic commerce  Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption  the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense  The originator of an encrypted message  Alice  shared the decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients  Bob   thereby precluding unwanted persons  Eve  from doing the same  The cryptography literature often uses Alice   A   for the sender  Bob   B   for the intended recipient  and Eve   eavesdropper   for the adversary  Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II  the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread  Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice  cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions  making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary  It is theoretically possible to break such a system  but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means  These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure  theoretical advances  e g   improvements in integer factorization algorithms  and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted  There exist information theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power an example is the one time pad but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms  The growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the information age  Cryptography s potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export  In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal  laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation  Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement of digital media Cyrillic scriptThe Cyrillic script  s  r l k  is a writing system used for various alphabets across eastern Europe and north and central Asia  It is based on the Early Cyrillic  which was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the  th century AD at the Preslav Literary School  It is the basis of alphabets used in various languages  past and present  in parts of southeastern Europe and northern Eurasia  especially those of Slavic origin  and non Slavic languages influenced by Russian  As of       around     million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages  with Russia accounting for about half of them  With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on   January       Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union  following the Latin script and Greek script  Cyrillic is derived from the Greek uncial script  augmented by letters from the older Glagolitic alphabet  including some ligatures  These additional letters were used for Old Church Slavonic sounds not found in Greek  The script is named in honor of the two Byzantine brothers  Saints Cyril and Methodius  who created the Glagolitic alphabet earlier on  Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by early disciples of Cyril and Methodius  In the early   th century the Cyrillic script used in Russia was heavily reformed by Peter the Great  who had recently returned from his Grand Embassy in western Europe  The new form of letters became closer to the Latin alphabet  several archaic letters were removed and several letters were personally designed by Peter the Great  such as   which was inspired by Latin R   West European typography culture was also adopted Czech languageCzech    t  k    e tina Czech pronunciation    t    c na    historically also Bohemian   bo  hi mi n  b     lingua Bohemica in Latin   is a West Slavic language of the Czech Slovak group  It is spoken by over    million people and is the official language of the Czech Republic  Czech is closely related to Slovak  to the point of being mutually intelligible to a very high degree  The Czech Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period  and the standardisation of Czech and Slovak within the Czech Slovak dialect continuum emerges in the early modern period  In the later   th to mid   th century  the modern written standard was codified in the context of the Czech National Revival  The main vernacular  known as Common Czech  is based on the vernacular of Prague  but is now spoken throughout most of the Czech Republic  The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are mostly also counted as Czech  although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak  The Czech phoneme inventory is moderate in size  comprising five vowels  each short or long  and twenty five consonants  divided into  hard    neutral  and  soft  categories   Words may contain uncommon  or complicated  consonant clusters  including one consonant represented by the grapheme    or lack vowels altogether  Czech orthography is simple  and has been used as a model by phonologists DD  named dee   di    is the fourth letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet Danish languageDanish   de n     dansk pronounced  d an s     dansk sprog    d an s    sb         is a North Germanic language spoken by around six million people  principally in Denmark and in the region of Southern Schleswig in northern Germany  where it has minority language status  There are also minor Danish speaking communities in Norway  Sweden  Spain  the United States  Canada  Brazil and Argentina  Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas  around        of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their home language  Along with the other North Germanic languages  Danish is a descendant of Old Norse  the common language of the Germanic peoples that lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era  Danish  together with Swedish  derives from the East Norse dialect group  while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokm l are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic  A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish  Norwegian and Swedish as Mainland Scandinavian while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as Insular Scandinavian  Until the   th century  Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions  With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing  a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect  It spread through use in the education system and administration though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the   th century  Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden  a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity  and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity with major works of literature produced in the   th and   th centuries  Today  traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared  though there are regional variants of the standard language  The main differences in language are between generations  with youth language being particularly innovative  Danish has a very large vowel inventory comprising    phonemically distinctive vowels  and its prosody is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon st d  a kind of laryngeal phonation type  Due to the many pronunciation differences that set apart Danish from its neighboring languages  particularly the vowels  difficult prosody and  weakly  pronounced consonants  it is sometimes considered to be a difficult language to learn and understand  and there is some evidence that small children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish  The grammar is moderately inflective with strong  irregular  and weak  regular  conjugations and inflections  Nouns and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender  As in English  Danish only has remnants of a former case system  particularly in the pronouns  and it has lost all person marking on verbs  Its syntax is V   with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence Data compressionIn signal processing  data compression  source coding  or bit rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation  Compression can be either lossy or lossless  Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy  No information is lost in lossless compression  Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information  The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression  In the context of data transmission  it is called source coding  encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted  in opposition to channel coding  Compression is useful because it reduces resources required to store and transmit data  Computational resources are consumed in the compression process and  usually  in the reversal of the process  decompression   Data compression is subject to a space time complexity trade off  For instance  a compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed  and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage  The design of data compression schemes involves trade offs among various factors  including the degree of compression  the amount of distortion introduced  when using lossy data compression   and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data DiacriticA diacritic   also diacritical mark  diacritical point  or diacritical sign   is a glyph added to a letter  or basic glyph  The term derives from the Ancient Greek              diakritik s   distinguishing    from           diakr  n    to distinguish    Diacritic is primarily an adjective  though sometimes used as a noun  whereas diacritical is only ever an adjective  Some diacritical marks  such as the acute       and grave        are often called accents  Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter  or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters  The main use of diacritical marks in the Latin script is to change the sound values of the letters to which they are added  Examples from English are the diaereses in na ve and No l  which show that the vowel with the diaeresis mark is pronounced separately from the preceding vowel  the acute and grave accents  which can indicate that a final vowel is to be pronounced  as in sak  and poetic breath d  and the cedilla under the  c  in the borrowed French word fa ade  which shows it is pronounced  s  rather than  k   In other Latin alphabets  they may distinguish between homonyms  such as the French l    there   versus la   the   that are both pronounced  la   In Gaelic type  a dot over a consonant indicates lenition of the consonant in question  In other alphabetic systems  diacritical marks may perform other functions  Vowel pointing systems  namely the Arabic harakat               etc   and the Hebrew niqqud                       etc   systems  indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet  The Indic virama     etc   and the Arabic suk n         mark the absence of a vowel  Cantillation marks indicate prosody  Other uses include the Early Cyrillic titlo        and the Hebrew gershayim        which  respectively  mark abbreviations or acronyms  and Greek diacritical marks  which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as numerals  In the Hanyu Pinyin official romanization system for Chinese  diacritics are used to mark the tones of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur  In orthography and collation  a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new  distinct letter or as a letter diacritic combination  This varies from language to language  and may vary from case to case within a language  In some cases  letters are used as  in line diacritics   with the same function as ancillary glyphs  in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them  as in the case of the  h  in the English pronunciation of  sh  and  th  Diaeresis  diacritic The diaeresis  UK  da   r s s   US  da   r s s  dy ERR i sis  plural  diaereses   also spelled di resis or dieresis and also known as the tr ma  also  trema  or the umlaut  is a diacritical mark that consists of two dots       placed over a letter  usually a vowel  When that letter is an i or a j  the diacritic replaces the tittle     The diaeresis and the umlaut are diacritics marking two distinct phonological phenomena  The diaeresis represents the phenomenon also known as diaeresis or hiatus in which a vowel letter is not pronounced as part of a digraph or diphthong  The umlaut     mla t  UUM lowt   in contrast  indicates a sound shift  These two diacritics originated separately  the diaeresis is considerably older  Nevertheless  in modern computer systems using Unicode  the umlaut and diaeresis diacritics are identical  e g  U   E    LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS  HTML            auml   represents both a umlaut and a diaeresis  The same symbol is also used as a diacritic in other cases  distinct from both diaeresis and umlaut  For example  in Albanian and Tagalog   represents a schwa Digraph  orthography A digraph or digram  from the Greek      d s   double  and       gr ph    to write   is a pair of characters used in the orthography of a language to write either a single phoneme  distinct sound   or a sequence of phonemes that does not correspond to the normal values of the two characters combined  Digraphs are often used for phonemes that cannot be represented using a single character  like the English sh in ship and fish  In other cases they may be relics from an earlier period of the language when they had a different pronunciation  or represent a distinction which is made only in certain dialects  like English wh  They may also be used for purely etymological reasons  like rh in English  Digraphs are used in some Romanization schemes  like the zh often used to represent the Russian letter    As an alternative to digraphs  orthographies and Romanization schemes sometimes use letters with diacritics  like the Czech    which has the same function as the English digraph sh  In some languages  orthographies  digraphs  and occasionally trigraphs  are considered individual letters  meaning that they have their own place in the alphabet  and cannot be separated into their constituent graphemes  e g  when sorting  abbreviating or hyphenating  Examples are found in Hungarian  cs  dz  dzs  gy  ly  ny  sz  ty  zs   Czech  ch   Slovak  ch  dz  d    Albanian  dh  gj  ll  nj  rr  sh  th  xh  zh  and Gaj s Latin Alphabet  lj  nj  d    In Dutch  when the digraph ij is capitalized  both letters are capitalized  IJ   Digraphs may develop into ligatures  but these are distinct concepts   a ligature involves a graphical combination of two characters  as when a and e are fused into   DiphthongA diphthong    d f     DIF thong or   d p     DIP thong  from Greek             diphthongos  literally  two sounds  or  two tones    also known as a gliding vowel  is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable  Technically  a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets  that is  the tongue  and or other parts of the speech apparatus  moves during the pronunciation of the vowel  In many dialects of English  the phrase no highway cowboys   no   ha we   ka b  z  has five distinct diphthongs  one in every syllable  Diphthongs contrast with monophthongs  where the tongue or other speech organs do not move and the syllable contains only a single vowel sound  For instance  in English  the word ah is spoken as a monophthong         while the word ow is spoken as a diphthong in most dialects   a     Where two adjacent vowel sounds occur in different syllables for example  in the English word re elect the result is described as hiatus  not as a diphthong  Diphthongs often form when separate vowels are run together in rapid speech during a conversation  However  there are also unitary diphthongs  as in the English examples above  which are heard by listeners as single vowel sounds  phonemes   Diphthongs use two vowel sounds in one syllable to make a speech sound Dot  diacritic When used as a diacritic mark  the term dot is usually reserved for the Interpunct        or to the glyphs  combining dot above         and  combining dot below         which may be combined with some letters of the extended Latin alphabets in use in Central European languages and Vietnamese Dutch languageDutch   Nederlands   is a West Germanic language that is spoken by around    million people as a first language including most of the population of the Netherlands and about sixty percent of Belgium and by another   million as a second language  It is the third most widely spoken Germanic language  after English and German  Outside of the Low Countries  it is the native language of the majority of the population of Suriname  and also holds official status in Aruba  Cura ao and Sint Maarten  which are constituent countries of the

United States  Canada and Australia combined  The Cape Dutch dialects of Southern Africa have evolved into Afrikaans  a mutually intelligible daughter language which is spoken to some degree by at least    million people  mainly in South Africa and Namibia  Dutch is one of the closest relatives of both German and English and is said to be roughly in between them  Dutch  like English  has not undergone the High German consonant shift  does not use Germanic umlaut as a grammatical marker  has largely abandoned the use of the subjunctive  and has levelled much of its morphology  including most of its case system  Features shared with German include the survival of three grammatical genders albeit with few grammatical consequences as well as the use of modal particles  final obstruent devoicing  and a similar word order  Dutch vocabulary is mostly Germanic and incorporates more Romance loans than German but far fewer than English EBCDICExtended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code  EBCDIC  is an eight bit character encoding used mainly on IBM mainframe and IBM midrange computer operating systems  EBCDIC descended from the code used with punched cards and the corresponding six

exponential function  The natural logarithm of a positive number k can be defined directly as the area under the curve y     x between x     and x   k  in which case e is the value of k for which this area equals one  see image   There are alternative characterizations  Sometimes called Euler s number after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler  e is not to be confused with    the Euler Mascheroni constant  sometimes called simply Euler s constant  The number e is also known as Napier s constant  but Euler s choice of the symbol e is said to have been retained in his honor  The constant was discovered by the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli while studying compound interest  The number e is of eminent importance in mathematics  alongside         and i  All five of these numbers play important and recurring roles across mathematics  and are the five constants appearing in one formulation of Euler s identity  Like the constant    e is irrational  it is not a ratio of integers  Also like    e is transcendental  it is not a root of any non zero polynomial with rational coefficients  The numerical value of e truncated to    decimal places isE with strokeE with stroke  majuscule

October          was an American writer  editor  and literary critic  Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories  particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre  He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole  and he was one of the country s earliest practitioners of the short story  Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction  He was the first well known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone  resulting in a financially difficult life and career  Poe was born in Boston  the second child of two actors  His father abandoned the family in       and his mother died the following year  Thus orphaned  the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond  Virginia  They never formally adopted him  but Poe was with them well into young adulthood  Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts  including those incurred by gambling  and the cost of secondary education for the young man  Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money  Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in      under an assumed name  It was at this time that his publishing career began  albeit humbly  with the anonymous collection of poems Tamerlane and Other Poems         credited only to  a Bostonian   With the death of Frances Allan in       Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement  However  Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point  declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer  and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan  Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals  becoming known for his own style of literary criticism  His work forced him to move among several cities  including Baltimore  Philadelphia  and New York City  In Richmond in       he married Virginia Clemm  his    year old cousin  In January       Poe published his poem  The Raven  to instant success  His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication  For years  he had been planning to produce his own journal The Penn  later renamed The Stylus   though he died before it could be produced  Poe died in Baltimore on October          at age     the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol  brain congestion  cholera  drugs  heart disease  rabies  suicide  tuberculosis  and other agents  Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world  as well as in specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography  Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature  music  films  and television  A number of his homes are dedicated museums today  The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre Egyptian hieroglyphsEgyptian hieroglyphs    ha  r   l f   ro     were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt  It combined logographic  syllabic and alphabetic elements  with a total of some       distinct characters  Cursive hieroglyphs were used for religious literature on papyrus and wood  The later hieratic and demotic Egyptian scripts are derived from hieroglyphic writing  Meroitic was a late derivation from Demotic  Use of hieroglyphic writing arises from proto literate symbol systems in the Early Bronze Age  around the   nd century BC  Naqada III   with the first decipherable sentence written in the Egyptian language dating to the Second Dynasty    th century BC   Egyptian hieroglyphs developed into a mature writing system used for monumental inscription in the classical language of the Middle Kingdom period  during this period  the system made use of about     distinct signs  The writing system continued to be used throughout the Late Period  as well as the Persian and Ptolemaic periods  Late survivals of hieroglyphic use are found well into the Roman period  extending into the  th century AD  With the closing of pagan temples in the  th century  knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was lost  and the script remained undeciphered throughout the medieval and early modern period  The decipherment of hieroglyphs would only be solved in the     s by Jean Fran ois Champollion  with the help of the Rosetta Stone Ehwaz Ehwaz is the reconstructed Proto Germanic name of the Elder Futhark

but spelled without the diphthong to avoid confusion with    oh  yew    The Proto Germanic vowel system was asymmetric and unstable  The difference between the long vowels expressed by   e and

but assigned new sound values to the redundant ones  futhorc  oh expressing a diphthong  In the case of the Gothic alphabet  where the names of the runes were re applied to letters derived from the Greek alphabet  the letter   e was named a  us  horse  as well  note that in Gothic orthography   a   represents monophthongic  e   English speaking worldApproximately     to     million people speak English as their first language  More than half of these      million  live in the United States  followed by some    million in England  the first place where English was spoken  English is the third largest language by number of native speakers  after Mandarin and Spanish  Estimates that include second language speakers vary greatly  from     million to more than   billion  David Crystal calculates that non native speakers as of      outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of   to    When combining native and non native speakers  English is the most widely spoken language worldwide  Besides the major varieties of English  such as American English  British English  Indian English  Canadian English  Australian English  Irish English  New Zealand English and their sub varieties  countries such as South Africa  the Philippines  Jamaica and Nigeria also have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from English based creole languages to Standard English English alphabetThe modern English alphabet is a Latin alphabet consisting of    letters  each having an uppercase and a lowercase form    the exact same letters that are found in the ISO basic Latin alphabet   The exact shape of printed letters varies depending on the typeface  nowadays commonly referred to as a font   The shape of handwritten letters can differ significantly from the standard printed form  and between individuals   especially when written in cursive style  See the individual letter articles for information about letter shapes and origins  follow the links on any of the uppercase letters above   Written English uses    digraphs  such as ch  sh  th  ph  wh  etc   but they are not considered separate letters of the alphabet  Some traditions also use two ligatures    and    or
