Addiction medicineAddiction medicine is a medical specialty that deals with the treatment of addiction  The specialty often crosses over into other areas  since various aspects of addiction fall within the fields of public health  psychology  social work  mental health counseling  psychiatry  and internal medicine  among others  Incorporated within the specialty are the processes of detoxification  rehabilitation  harm reduction  abstinence based treatment  individual and group therapies  oversight of halfway houses  treatment of withdrawal related symptoms  acute intervention  and long term therapies designed to reduce likelihood of relapse  Some specialists  primarily those who also have expertise in family medicine or internal medicine  also provide treatment for disease states commonly associated with substance use  such as hepatitis and HIV infection  Physicians specializing in the field are in general agreement concerning applicability of treatment to those with addiction to drugs  such as alcohol and heroin  and often also to gambling  which has similar characteristics and has been well described in the scientific literature  There is less agreement concerning definition or treatment of other so called addictive behavior such as sexual addiction and internet addiction  such behaviors not being marked generally by physiologic tolerance or withdrawal  Doctors focusing on addiction medicine are medical specialists who focus on addictive disease and have had special study and training focusing on the prevention and treatment of such diseases  There are two routes to specialization in the addiction field  one via a psychiatric pathway and one via other fields of medicine  The American Society of Addiction Medicine notes that approximately     of its members are psychiatrists  MD DO  while the remainder have received primary medical training in other fields  In several countries around the world  specialist bodies have been set up to ensure high quality practice in addiction medicine  For example  within the United States  there are two accepted specialty examinations  One is a Board Certification in Addiction Psychiatry from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology  The other is a Board Certification in Addiction Medicine from the American Board of Preventive Medicine  The latter approach is available to all physicians with primary Board certification  while the former is available only to board certified psychiatrists  Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine may also seek board certification via the American Osteopathic Association  AOA   The Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine must have a primary board certification in Neurology   Psychiatry or Internal Medicine from the American Osteopathic Association and complete an AOA approved addiction medicine fellowship  Successful completion of a board examination administered via the AOA will grant a certificate of added qualification  CAQ  in addiction medicine  Within Australia  addiction medicine specialists are certified via the Chapter of Addiction Medicine  which is part of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians  They may alternatively be a member of the Section of Addiction Psychiatry  Royal Australian   New Zealand College of Psychiatrists  The International Society of Addiction Medicine also can provide certification of expertise Adolescent medicineAdolescent medicine or hebiatrics is a medical subspecialty that focuses on care of patients who are in the adolescent period of development  generally ranging from the last years of elementary school until graduation from high school  some doctors in this subspecialty treat young adults attending college at area clinics  in the subfield of college health   Patients have generally entered puberty  which typically begins between the ages of    and    for boys  In developed nations  the period of adolescence is extended both by an earlier start  as onset of puberty is beginning earlier  and a later end  requiring more years of education or training before economic independence from parents  Issues with a high prevalence during adolescence are frequently addressed by providers  These include  Sexually transmitted disease  working with specialists in pediatric endocrinology  adolescent obstetrics and gynecology  immunology infectious diseases  and urology and reproductive medicine  Unintended pregnancy  working with specialists in adolescent obstetrics and gynecology  especially in neonatology and maternal fetal medicine  many   though not all   are medically risky or high risk cases or to those with psychosocial  environmental  and socioeconomic challenges  Birth control  there is currently a drive in the United States federal government s health care policymaking to ensure access to any and all prescription or non prescription contraceptive methods to adolescent minors who request them  especially if they are over a certain age  Sexual activity  such as masturbation  sexual intercourse and sexual abuse  Substance abuse Menstrual disorders  such as amenorrhea  dysmenorrhea and dysfunctional uterine bleeding  Acne  working with specialists in dermatology who treat adolescents  Eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa  working with nutritionists and dieticians  and also specialists in pediatric mental health counseling  clinical psychology  and pediatric psychiatry  who work with adolescents  Certain mental illnesses  especially personality disorders  anxiety disorders  major depression and suicide  bipolar disorder  and certain types of schizophrenia  in concert with mental health counselors  clinical psychologists  and pediatric psychiatrists specializing in adolescent health care  Delayed or precocious puberty  often working with specialists in adolescent pediatric endocrinology  urology  and andrology AfricaAfrica is the world s second largest and second most populous continent  At about      million km        million square miles  including adjacent islands  it covers    of Earth s total surface area and        of its total land area  With     billion people as of       it accounts for about     of the world s human population  The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north  both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast  the Indian Ocean to the southeast  and the Atlantic Ocean to the west  The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos  It contains    fully recognized sovereign states  countries   nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition  Africa s population is the youngest amongst all the continents  the median age in      was       when the worldwide median age was       Algeria is Africa s largest country by area  and Nigeria by population  Africa  particularly central Eastern Africa  is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade  great apes   as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors  as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago  including Sahelanthropus tchadensis  Australopithecus africanus  A  afarensis  Homo erectus  H  habilis and H  ergaster   with the earliest Homo sapiens  modern human  found in Ethiopia being dated to circa         years ago  Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas  it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones  Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities  cultures and languages  In the late   th century European countries colonized most of Africa  Africa also varies greatly with regard to environments  economics  historical ties and government systems  However  most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonization in the   th century AgarAgar  pronounced   e    r   US       r   or agar agar is a jelly like substance  equivalent to vegan gelatin  obtained from algae  It was discovered in the late     s or early     s by Mino Tar zaemon in Japan  where it is called kanten  Agar is derived from the polysaccharide agarose  which forms the supporting structure in the cell walls of certain species of algae  and which is released on boiling  These algae are known as agarophytes and belong to the Rhodophyta  red algae  phylum  Agar is actually the resulting mixture of two components  the linear polysaccharide agarose  and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called agaropectin  Throughout history into modern times  agar has been chiefly used as an ingredient in desserts throughout Asia and also as a solid substrate to contain culture media for microbiological work  Agar can be used as a laxative  an appetite suppressant  a vegetarian substitute for gelatin  a thickener for soups  in fruit preserves  ice cream  and other desserts  as a clarifying agent in brewing  and for sizing paper and fabrics  The gelling agent in agar is an unbranched polysaccharide obtained from the cell walls of some species of red algae  primarily from the genera Gelidium and Gracilaria  For commercial purposes  it is derived primarily from Gelidium amansii  In chemical terms  agar is a polymer made up of subunits of the sugar galactose AllergyAllergies  also known as allergic diseases  are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to something in the environment that usually causes little or no problem in most people  These diseases include hay fever  food allergies  atopic dermatitis  allergic asthma  and anaphylaxis  Symptoms may include red eyes  an itchy rash  runny nose  shortness of breath  or swelling  Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions  Common allergens include pollen and certain food  Metals and other substances may also cause problems  Food  insect stings  and medications are common causes of severe reactions  Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors  The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies  IgE   part of the body s immune system  binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine  Diagnosis is typically based on a person s medical history  Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases  Positive tests  however  may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question  Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective  Treatments for allergies include avoiding known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines  In severe reactions injectable adrenaline  epinephrine  is recommended  Allergen immunotherapy  which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen  is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites  Its use in food allergies is unclear  Allergies are common  In the developed world  about     of people are affected by allergic rhinitis  about    of people have at least one food allergy  and about     have atopic dermatitis at some point in time  Depending on the country about       of people have asthma  Anaphylaxis occurs in between         of people  Rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing  The word  allergy  was first used by Clemens von Pirquet in      Allied health professionsAllied health professions are health care professions distinct from nursing  medicine  and pharmacy  They work in health care teams to make the health care system function by providing a range of diagnostic  technical  therapeutic and direct patient care and support services that are critical to the other health professionals they work with and the patients they serve American Osteopathic Board of PathologyThe American Osteopathic Board of Pathology  AOBPa  is an organization that provides board certification to qualified Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine  D O   who specialize in the diagnosis and characterization of disease in patients following thorough examination of biopsies and or bodily fluids  pathologists   The board is one    medical specialty certifying boards of the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists approved by the American Osteopathic Association  AOA   and was established in       As of December          osteopathic pathologists held active certification with the AOBPa  In addition to fellows of the American Board of Pathology  board certified osteopathic pathologists are eligible for admission to the College of American Pathologists and to the American Society for Mohs Surgery   Anatomical pathologyAnatomical pathology  Commonwealth  or Anatomic pathology  U S   is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the macroscopic  microscopic  biochemical  immunologic and molecular examination of organs and tissues  Over the last century  surgical pathology has evolved tremendously  from historical examination of whole bodies  autopsy  to a more modernized practice  centered on the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer to guide treatment decision making in oncology  Its modern founder was the Italian scientist Giovan Battista Morgagni from Forl   Anatomical pathology is one of two branches of pathology  the other being clinical pathology  the diagnosis of disease through the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids and or tissues  Often  pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology  a combination known as general pathology  Similar specialties exist in veterinary pathology Anatomical pathologyAnatomical pathology

and          logia  is the medical specialty that deals with male health  particularly relating to the problems of the male reproductive system and urological problems that are unique to men  It is also known as  the science of men   It is the counterpart to gynaecology  which deals with medical issues which are specific to the female reproductive system  However  unlike gynaecology  which has a plethora of medical board certification programs worldwide  andrology has none  Andrology has only been studied as a distinct specialty since the late     s  the first specialist journal on the subject was the German periodical Andrologie  now called Andrologia   published from      onwards  Male specific medical and surgical procedures include vasectomy  vasovasostomy  one of the vasectomy reversal procedures   orchidopexy and circumcision as well as intervention to deal with male genitourinary disorders such as the following AnesthesiologyAnesthesiology  anaesthesia or anaesthetics is the medical speciality that focuses on perioperative medicine and the administration of anesthesia  The American Society of Anesthesiologists define anesthesiology as  the practice of medicine dedicated to the relief of pain and total care of the surgical patient before  during and after surgery   Terminology varies between countries  In North America  the medical speciality is called anesthesiology  a doctor practising it is termed an anesthesiologist  and the treatment delivered is referred to as anesthesia  By contrast  in the United Kingdom and other countries following the British tradition  both the medical speciality and the treatment delivered are referred to as anaesthesia or anaesthetics  and the physician who performs them is termed an anaesthetist  in North America  the word anesthetist indicates a certified anesthesiologist assistant who delivers anesthesia under the supervision of a physician  or certified registered nurse anesthetist who in most states in the U S  require physician supervision  One of the fundamental practices of anesthesiologists is that of general anesthesia in which a person is placed in a medical coma  This is performed to permit surgery without the individual responding to pain  analgesia  during surgery or remembering the surgery  If general anesthesia is not necessary  then regional anesthesia can be performed to induce analgesia in a region of the body  For example  epidural administration of a local anesthetic is commonly performed on the mother during childbirth to reduce the pain while permitting the mother to be awake and active in labor   delivery  general anesthesia would not permit this   Anesthesiologists often also undertake non surgical pain relief and critical care management that includes working in an intensive care unit AngiologyAngiology  from Greek          ange on   vessel   and          logia  is the medical specialty which studies the diseases of the circulatory system and of the lymphatic system  i e   arteries  veins and lymphatic vases  and its diseases  In the UK this field is more often termed angiology  and in the United States the term vascular medicine is more frequent  The field of vascular medicine  angiology  is the field that deals with preventing  diagnosing and treating vascular and blood vessel related diseases ApoptosisApoptosis  from Ancient Greek            falling off   is a process of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms  Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes  morphology  and death  These changes include blebbing  cell shrinkage  nuclear fragmentation  chromatin condensation  chromosomal DNA fragmentation  and global mRNA decay  Between    and    billion cells die each day due to apoptosis in the average human adult  For an average child between the ages of   and     approximately    billion to    billion cells die a day  In contrast to necrosis  which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury  apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism s lifecycle  For example  the separation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis  Unlike necrosis  apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to the neighboring cells  Because apoptosis cannot stop once it has begun  it is a highly regulated process  Apoptosis can be initiated through one of two pathways  In the intrinsic pathway the cell kills itself because it senses cell stress  while in the extrinsic pathway the cell kills itself because of signals from other cells  Both pathways induce cell death by activating caspases  which are proteases  or enzymes that degrade proteins  The two pathways both activate initiator caspases  which then activate executioner caspases  which then kill the cell by degrading proteins indiscriminately  Research on apoptosis has increased substantially since the early     s  In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon  defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases  Excessive apoptosis causes atrophy  whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation  such as cancer  Some factors like Fas receptors and caspases promote apoptosis  while some members of the Bcl   family of proteins inhibit apoptosis AsiaAsia    e      e      is Earth s largest and most populous continent  located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and shares the continental landmass of Afro Eurasia with both Europe and Africa  Asia covers an area of            square kilometres             sq mi   about     of Earth s total land area and      of the Earth s total surface area  The continent  which has long been home to the majority of the human population  was the site of many of the first civilizations  Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population  but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of     billion people  In general terms  Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean  on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean  The western boundary with Europe is a historical and cultural construct  as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them  The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal  the Ural River  and the Ural Mountains  and south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas  China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from   to      A D  China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east  and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia  attracting European commerce  exploration and colonialism  The accidental discovery of America by Columbus in search for India demonstrates this deep fascination  The Silk Road became the main East West trading route in the Asian hitherland while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route  Asia has exhibited economic dynamism  particularly East Asia  as well as robust population growth during the   th century  but overall population growth has since fallen  Asia was the birthplace of most of the world s mainstream religions including Christianity  Islam  Judaism  Hinduism  Buddhism  Confucianism  Taoism  or Daoism   Jainism  Sikhism  Zoroastranism  as well as many other religions  Given its size and diversity  the concept of Asia a name dating back to classical antiquity may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography  Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups  cultures  environments  economics  historical ties and government systems  It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East  temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia Assisted reproductive technologyAssisted reproductive technology  ART  is the technology used to achieve pregnancy in procedures such as fertility medication  in vitro fertilization and surrogacy  It is reproductive technology used primarily for infertility treatments  and is also known as fertility treatment  It mainly belongs to the field of reproductive endocrinology and infertility  and may also include intracytoplasmic sperm injection  ICSI  and cryopreservation  Some forms of ART are also used with regard to fertile couples for genetic reasons  preimplantation genetic diagnosis   ART is also used for couples who are discordant for certain communicable diseases  for example  HIV to reduce the risk of infection when a pregnancy is desired AtrophyAtrophy is the partial or complete wasting away of a part of the body  Causes of atrophy include mutations  which can destroy the gene to build up the organ   poor nourishment  poor circulation  loss of hormonal support  loss of nerve supply to the target organ  excessive amount of apoptosis of cells  and disuse or lack of exercise or disease intrinsic to the tissue itself  In medical practice  hormonal and nerve inputs that maintain an organ or body part are said to have trophic effects  A diminished muscular trophic condition is designated as atrophy  Atrophy is the general physiological process of reabsorption and breakdown of tissues  involving apoptosis  When it occurs as a result of disease or loss of trophic support due to other disease  it is termed pathological atrophy  although it can be a part of normal body development and homeostasis as well Automated analyserAn automated analyser is a medical laboratory instrument designed to measure different chemicals and other characteristics in a number of biological samples quickly  with minimal human assistance   These measured properties of blood and other fluids may be useful in the diagnosis of disease  Many methods of introducing samples into the analyser have been invented  This can involve placing test tubes of sample into racks  which can be moved along a track  or inserting tubes into circular carousels that rotate to make the sample available  Some analysers require samples to be transferred to sample cups  However  the effort to protect the health and safety of laboratory staff has prompted many manufacturers to develop analysers that feature closed tube sampling  preventing workers from direct exposure to samples   Samples can be processed singly  in batches  or continuously  The automation of laboratory testing does not remove the need for human expertise  results must still be evaluated by medical technologists and other qualified clinical laboratory professionals   but it does ease concerns about error reduction  staffing concerns  and safety AutopsyAn autopsy also known as a post mortem examination  obduction  necropsy  or autopsia cadaverum  is a highly specialized surgical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a corpse by dissection to determine the cause and manner of death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present  It is usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist  Autopsies are performed for either legal or medical purposes  For example  a forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter  while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death  or for research purposes  Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices  and those where the body is dissected and internal examination is conducted  Permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases  Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is reconstituted by sewing it back together Bachelor of Medical SciencesA Bachelor of Medical Science  BMedSci  BMedSc  BMSc  BSci Med   or Bachelor of Medical Sciences is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for completed courses that generally last for     years  Acceleration modes are offered for students who decide to fast track the duration of a relevant degree or pathway to graduate medical training  Doctor of Medicine  earlier  as opposed to completing a typical undergraduate degree which lasts     years  Medical science students learn in depth about the human body  developing skills and knowledge on how the human body functions and how it reacts to disease and the drugs that are used to treat disease  It is possible for students to take an additional year that involves research that allows them to be conferred honours  BMedSc Hons   but this usually requires a set GPA  Graduates may enter a diverse range of roles including graduate entry clinical medicine  academic research  pharmaceuticals and broader consulting roles Bachelor of Medicine  Bachelor of SurgeryBachelor of Medicine  Bachelor of Surgery  or in Latin  Medicinae Baccalaureus  Baccalaureus Chirurgiae  abbreviated in many ways  e g  MBBS  MBChB  MBBCh  MB BChir  Cantab   BM BCh  Oxon   BMBS   are the two first professional degrees in medicine and surgery awarded upon graduation from medical school by universities in countries that follow the tradition of the United Kingdom  The historical degree nomenclature suggests that they are two separate undergraduate degrees  however  in practice  they are usually treated as one and conferred together  and may also be awarded at graduate level medical schools  In countries that follow the system in the United States  the equivalent medical degree is awarded as Doctor of Medicine  MD  or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine  DO  BacteriaBacteria   b k t  ri    common noun bacteria  singular bacterium  constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms  Typically a few micrometres in length  bacteria have a number of shapes  ranging from spheres to rods and spirals  Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth  and are present in most of its habitats  Bacteria inhabit soil  water  acidic hot springs  radioactive waste  and the deep portions of Earth s crust  Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals  Most bacteria have not been characterised  and only about half of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory  The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology  a branch of microbiology  There are typically    million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water  There are approximately        bacteria on Earth  forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals  Bacteria are vital in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere  The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies and bacteria are responsible for the putrefaction stage in this process  In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps  extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds  such as hydrogen sulphide and methane  to energy  In March       data reported by researchers in October       was published  It was suggested that bacteria thrive in the Mariana Trench  which with a depth of up to    kilometres is the deepest known part of the oceans  Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to     metres below the sea floor under     kilometres of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States  According to one of the researchers   You can find microbes everywhere they re extremely adaptable to conditions  and survive wherever they are   There are approximately ten times as many bacterial cells in the human microbiota as there are human cells in the body  with their largest number being in the gut flora  and a large number on the skin  The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system  though many are beneficial particularly in the gut flora  However several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases  including cholera  syphilis  anthrax  leprosy  and bubonic plague  The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections  with tuberculosis alone killing about   million people per year  mostly in sub Saharan Africa  In developed countries  antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming  making antibiotic resistance a growing problem  In industry  bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills  the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation  and the recovery of gold  palladium  copper and other metals in the mining sector  as well as in biotechnology  and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals  Once regarded as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes  bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes  Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes  bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane bound organelles  Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes  the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the     s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor  These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea BacteriologyBacteriology is the branch and specialty of biology that studies the morphology  ecology  genetics and biochemistry of bacteria as well as many other aspects related to them   This subdivision of microbiology involves the identification  classification  and characterization of bacterial species  A person who studies bacteriology is a bacteriologist BloodBlood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells  In vertebrates  it is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma  Plasma  which constitutes     of blood fluid  is mostly water      by volume   and contains dissipated proteins  glucose  mineral ions  hormones  carbon dioxide  plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation   and blood cells themselves  Albumin is the main protein in plasma  and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood  The blood cells are mainly red blood cells  also called RBCs or erythrocytes   white blood cells  also called WBCs or leukocytes  and platelets  also called thrombocytes   The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells  These contain hemoglobin  an iron containing protein  which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood  In contrast  carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as bicarbonate ion transported in plasma  Vertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated  Some animals  such as crustaceans and mollusks  use hemocyanin to carry oxygen  instead of hemoglobin  Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood  the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system  In most insects  this  blood  does not contain oxygen carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen  Jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system  based largely on white blood cells  White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites  Platelets are important in the clotting of blood  Arthropods  using hemolymph  have hemocytes as part of their immune system  Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart  In animals with lungs  arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body  and venous blood carries carbon dioxide  a waste product of metabolism produced by cells  from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled  Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo  or hemato   also spelled haemo  and haemato   from the Greek word       haima  for  blood   In terms of anatomy and histology  blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue  given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen Blood bankA blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation  stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion  The term  blood bank  typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed  to reduce the risk of transfusion related adverse events   However  it sometimes refers to a collection center  and indeed some hospitals also perform collection  For blood donation agencies in various countries  see List of blood donation agencies and List of blood donation agencies in the United States Blood bankA blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation  stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion  The term  blood bank  typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed  to reduce the risk of transfusion related adverse events   However  it sometimes refers to a collection center  and indeed some hospitals also perform collection  For blood donation agencies in various countries  see List of blood donation agencies and List of blood donation agencies in the United States Body fluidBody fluid  bodily fluids or biofluids are liquids originating from inside the bodies of living people  They include fluids that are excreted or secreted from the body  and body water that normally is not  The dominating content of body fluids is body water  Approximately        of body water is contained within the cells  in intracellular fluid  with the other        of body water contained outside the cells  in extracellular fluid   This fluid component outside the cells includes the fluid between the cells  interstitial fluid   lymph and blood  There are approximately   to    liters of lymph in the body  compared to     to   liters of blood Cardiac surgeryCardiovascular  heart  surgery is surgery on the heart or great vessels performed by cardiac surgeons  Frequently  it is done to treat complications of ischemic heart disease  for example  coronary artery bypass grafting   correct congenital heart disease  or treat valvular heart disease from various causes including endocarditis  rheumatic heart disease and atherosclerosis  It also includes heart transplantation CardiologyCardiology  from Greek        kardi    heart  and         logia   study   is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the heart as well as parts of the circulatory system  The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects  coronary artery disease  heart failure  valvular heart disease and electrophysiology  Physicians who specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists  a specialty of internal medicine  Pediatric cardiologists are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology  Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called cardiothoracic surgeons or cardiac surgeons  a specialty of general surgery  Although the cardiovascular system is inextricably linked to blood  cardiology is relatively unconcerned with hematology and its diseases  Some obvious exceptions that affect the function of the heart would be blood tests  electrolyte disturbances  troponins   decreased oxygen carrying capacity  anemia  hypovolemic shock   and coagulopathies Cardiothoracic surgeryCardiothoracic surgery  also known as thoracic surgery  is the field of medicine involved in surgical treatment of organs inside the thorax  the chest  generally treatment of conditions of the heart  heart disease  and lungs  lung disease   In most countries  cardiac surgery  involving the heart and the great vessels  and general thoracic surgery  involving the lungs  esophagus  thymus  etc   are separate surgical specialties  the exceptions are the United States  Australia  New Zealand  and some EU countries  such as the United Kingdom and Portugal   Caseous necrosisCaseous necrosis is a form of cell death in which the tissue maintains a cheese like appearance  The dead tissue appears as a soft and white proteinaceous dead cell mass Cell damageCell damage can occur as a result of an adverse stimulus which disrupts the normal homeostasis of affected cells  Among other causes  this can be due to physical  chemical  infectious  biological  nutritional or immunological factors  Cell damage can be reversible or irreversible  Depending on the extent of injury  the cellular response may be adaptive and where possible  homeostasis is restored  Cell death occurs when the severity of the injury exceeds the cell s ability to repair itself  Cell death is relative to both the length of exposure to a harmful stimulus and the severity of the damage caused  Cell death may occur by necrosis or apoptosis Cell deathCell death is the event of a biological cell ceasing to carry out its functions  This may be the result of the natural process of old cells dying and being replaced by new ones  or may result from such factors as disease  localized injury  or the death of the organism of which the cells are part  Kinds of cell death include  Programmed cell death  or PCD  is cell death mediated by an intracellular program  PCD is carried out in a regulated process  which usually confers advantage during an organism s life cycle  For example  the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose  the result is that the digits are separate  PCD serves fundamental functions during both plant and metazoa  multicellular animals  tissue development  Apoptosis or Type I cell death  and autophagy or Type II cell death are both forms of programmed cell death  while necrosis is a non physiological process that occurs as a result of infection or injury  Necrosis is cell death caused by external factors such as trauma or infection  and occurs in several different forms  Recently a form of programmed necrosis  called necroptosis  has been recognized as an alternate form of programmed cell death  It is hypothesized that necroptosis can serve as a cell death backup to apoptosis when the apoptosis signaling is blocked by endogenous or exogenous factors such as viruses or mutations  Mitotic catastrophe is a mode of cell death that is due to premature or inappropriate entry of cells into mitosis  It is the most common mode of cell death in cancer cells exposed to ionizing radiation and many other anti cancer treatments  Autophagy is cytoplasmic  characterized by the formation of large vacuoles that eat away organelles in a specific sequence prior to the destruction of the nucleus  Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death  PCD  that may occur in multicellular organisms  Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes  morphology  and death  These changes include blebbing  cell shrinkage  nuclear fragmentation  chromatin condensation  and chromosomal DNA fragmentation  It is now thought that   in a developmental context   cells are induced to positively commit suicide whilst in a homeostatic context  the absence of certain survival factors may provide the impetus for suicide  There appears to be some variation in the morphology and indeed the biochemistry of these suicide pathways  some treading the path of  apoptosis   others following a more generalized pathway to deletion  but both usually being genetically and synthetically motivated  There is some evidence that certain symptoms of  apoptosis  such as endonuclease activation can be spuriously induced without engaging a genetic cascade  however  presumably true apoptosis and programmed cell death must be genetically mediated  It is also becoming clear that mitosis and apoptosis are toggled or linked in some way and that the balance achieved depends on signals received from appropriate growth or survival factors  Macroautophagy  often referred to as autophagy  is a catabolic process that results in the autophagosomic lysosomal degradation of bulk cytoplasmic contents  abnormal protein aggregates  and excess or damaged organelles  Autophagy is generally activated by conditions of nutrient deprivation but has also been associated with physiological as well as pathological processes such as development  differentiation  neurodegenerative diseases  stress  infection and cancer  Other pathways of programmed cell death have been discovered  Called  non apoptotic programmed cell death   or  caspase independent programmed cell death  or  necroptosis    these alternative routes to death are as efficient as apoptosis and can function as either backup mechanisms or the main type of PCD  Other forms of programmed cell death include anoikis  almost identical to apoptosis except in its induction  cornification  a form of cell death exclusive to the eyes  excitotoxicity  ferroptosis  an iron dependent form of cell death and Wallerian degeneration  Plant cells undergo particular processes of PCD similar to autophagic cell death  However  some common features of PCD are highly conserved in both plants and metazoa  Activation induced cell death  AICD  is a programmed cell death caused by the interaction of Fas receptor  Fas  CD   and Fas ligand  FasL  CD   ligand   It occurs as a result of repeated stimulation of specific T cell receptors  TCR  and it helps to maintain the periphery immune tolerance  Therefore  an alteration of the process may lead to autoimmune diseases  In the other words AICD is the negative regulator of activated T lymphocytes  Ischemic cell death  or oncosis  is a form of accidental  or passive cell death that is often considered a lethal injury  The process is characterized by mitochondrial swelling  cytoplasm vacuolization  and swelling of the nucleus and cytoplasm  Immunogenic cell death or immunogenic apoptosis is a form of cell death caused by some cytostatic agents such as anthracyclines  oxaliplatin and bortezomib  or radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy  PDT  Cellular adaptationIn cell biology and pathophysiology  cellular adaptation refers to changes made by a cell in response to adverse environmental changes  The adaptation may be physiologic al   normal  or pathologic al   abnormal   Five major types of adaptation include atrophy  hypertrophy  hyperplasia  dysplasia  and metaplasia Chief physicianA chief physician  also called a head physician  senior consultant  or chief of medicine  is a physician in a senior management position at a hospital or other institution  In many institutions  it is the title of the most senior physician  but it may also be used as the title of the most senior physician of a particular department within a larger institution  A chief physician generally is in charge of medical matters and often is the superior of other physicians  including consultants and attending physicians   but may also be in charge of other professional groups and areas of responsibility ChromatographyChromatography    kro m  t  r fi   from Greek       chroma which means  color  and         graphein  to write   is a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture  The mixture is dissolved in a fluid called the mobile phase  which carries it through a structure holding another material called the stationary phase  The various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds  causing them to separate  The separation is based on differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases  Subtle differences in a compound s partition coefficient result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus changing the separation  Chromatography may be preparative or analytical  The purpose of preparative chromatography is to separate the components of a mixture for more advanced use  and is thus a form of purification   Analytical chromatography is done normally with smaller amounts of material and is for measuring the relative proportions  or establishing the presence  of analytes in a mixture  The two are not mutually exclusive Clinical biologistA clinical biologist is a health professional such as  a doctor in medicine  pharmacist  biologist that is specialized in clinical biology  a medical specialty derived from clinical pathology  In fact  the subspecializations in clinical biology could be considered more important than clinical pathology  The concept includes interventional biology which is like assisted reproductive technology  These professionals follow a medical residency whose duration varies between countries  from   to   years   This term is frequently used in France  Belgium and other countries in Western Europe  Africa or Asia Clinical chemistryClinical chemistry  also known as chemical pathology  clinical biochemistry or medical biochemistry  is the area of clinical pathology that is generally concerned with analysis of bodily fluids for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes  It is an applied form of biochemistry  not to be confused with medicinal chemistry  which involves basic research for drug development   The discipline originated in the late   th century with the use of simple chemical reaction tests for various components of blood and urine  In the many decades since  other techniques have been applied as science and technology have advanced  including the use and measurement of enzyme activities  spectrophotometry  electrophoresis  and immunoassay  There are now many blood tests and clinical urine tests with extensive diagnostic capabilities  Most current laboratories are now highly automated to accommodate the high workload typical of a hospital laboratory  Tests performed are closely monitored and quality controlled  All biochemical tests come under chemical pathology  These are performed on any kind of body fluid  but mostly on serum or plasma  Serum is the yellow watery part of blood that is left after blood has been allowed to clot and all blood cells have been removed  This is most easily done by centrifugation  which packs the denser blood cells and platelets to the bottom of the centrifuge tube  leaving the liquid serum fraction resting above the packed cells  This initial step before analysis has recently been included in instruments that operate on the  integrated system  principle  Plasma is in essence the same as serum  but is obtained by centrifuging the blood without clotting  Plasma is obtained by centrifugation before clotting occurs  The type of test required dictates what type of sample is used  A large medical laboratory will accept samples for up to about     different kinds of tests  Even the largest of laboratories rarely do all these tests themselves  and some must be referred to other labs  This large array of tests can be categorised into sub specialities of  General or routine chemistry   commonly ordered blood chemistries  e g   liver and kidney function tests   Special chemistry   elaborate techniques such as electrophoresis  and manual testing methods  Clinical endocrinology   the study of hormones  and diagnosis of endocrine disorders  Toxicology   the study of drugs of abuse and other chemicals  Therapeutic Drug Monitoring   measurement of therapeutic medication levels to optimize dosage  Urinalysis   chemical analysis of urine for a wide array of diseases  along with other fluids such as CSF and effusions Fecal analysis   mostly for detection of gastrointestinal disorders ImmunologyImmunology is a branch of biology that covers the study of immune systems in all organisms  It was the Russian biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov who boosted studies on immunology  and received the Nobel Prize in      for his work  He jabbed the thorn of a rose on a starfish and noted that     hours later  cells were surrounding the tip  It was an active response of the body  trying to maintain its integrity  It was Mechnikov who first observed the phenomenon of phagocytosis  in which the body defends itself against a foreign body  and coined the term  It charts  measures  and contextualizes the  physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases  malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders  such as autoimmune diseases  hypersensitivities  immune deficiency  and transplant rejection   the physical  chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system in vitro  in situ  and in vivo  Immunology has applications in numerous disciplines of medicine  particularly in the fields of organ transplantation  oncology  virology  bacteriology  parasitology  psychiatry  and dermatology  Prior to the designation of immunity from the etymological root immunis  which is Latin for  exempt   early physicians characterized organs that would later be proven as essential components of the immune system  The important lymphoid organs of the immune system are the thymus and bone marrow  and chief lymphatic tissues such as spleen  tonsils  lymph vessels  lymph nodes  adenoids  and liver  When health conditions worsen to emergency status  portions of immune system organs including the thymus  spleen  bone marrow  lymph nodes and other lymphatic tissues can be surgically excised for examination while patients are still alive  Many components of the immune system are typically cellular in nature and not associated with any specific organ  but rather are embedded or circulating in various tissues located throughout the body Clinical MicrobiologyClinical microbiology is a branch of medical science concerned with the prevention  diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases  In addition  this field of science studies various clinical applications of microbes for the improvement of health  There are four kinds of microorganisms that cause infectious disease  bacteria  fungi  parasites and viruses  and one type of infectious protein called prion  A medical microbiologist studies the characteristics of pathogens  their modes of transmission  mechanisms of infection and growth  Using this information  a treatment can be devised  Medical microbiologists often serve as consultants for physicians  providing identification of pathogens and suggesting treatment options  Other tasks may include the identification of potential health risks to the community or monitoring the evolution of potentially virulent or resistant strains of microbes  educating the community and assisting in the design of health practices  They may also assist in preventing or controlling epidemics and outbreaks of disease  Not all medical microbiologists study microbial pathology  some study common  non pathogenic species to determine whether their properties can be used to develop antibiotics or other treatment methods  Whilst epidemiology is the study of the patterns  causes  and effects of health and disease conditions in populations  medical microbiology primarily focuses on the presence and growth of microbial infections in individuals  their effects on the human body and the methods of treating those infections Clinical neurophysiologyClinical neurophysiology is a medical specialty that studies the central and peripheral nervous systems through the recording of bioelectrical activity  whether spontaneous or stimulated  It encompasses both research regarding the pathophysiology along with clinical methods used to diagnose diseases involving both central and peripheral nervous systems  Examinations in the clinical neurophysiology field are not limited to tests conducted in a laboratory  It is thought of as an extension of a neurologic consultation  Tests that are conducted are concerned with measuring the electrical functions of the brain  spinal cord  and nerves in the limbs and muscles  It can give the precise definition of site  the type and degree of the lesion  along with revealing the abnormalities that are in question  Due to these abilities  clinical neurophysiology is used to mainly help diagnose diseases rather than treat them  In some countries it is a part of neurology or psychiatry  for example the United States and Germany  In other countries it is an autonomous specialty  such as Spain  Portugal  Italy  the United Kingdom  Finland  Sweden and Norway  Hospitals that have neurologists and neurosurgeons tend to house clinical neurophysiology departments  Usually these tend to be larger hospitals that are able to employ more specialized staff units  In hospitals that possess clinical neurophysiology facilities  the major diagnostic modalities employed include  Electromyography and nerve conduction studies  These diagnostic tests of the peripheral nervous system  especially useful in evaluating diseases of the muscles  nerves  and nerve roots  Records electrical activity of the muscles and the passage of them along nerves in the limbs  Most nerve muscle disorders that occur fall into one of two types of categories  morphologic or physiologic  which can be seen within the motor unit  These disorders can either be acute  or have a slow developing nature  An online tool that allows the interactive exploration of these neurophysiological methods and of symptoms to which they are related can be found here  Electroencephalography  Diagnostic test of thalamocortical rhythms  brain waves   useful in evaluating seizures and various abnormalities of the central nervous system  This is done by hooking up electrodes on the surface of the scalp to record currents from the cerebral cortex  Evoked potentials  Diagnostic test evaluating specific tracts of the central and peripheral nervous system  May include visual  auditory  or somatosensory evoked potentials  These record the electrical responses of the brain and spinal cord to the stimulation of the senses  Polysomnography  A type of sleep study employed to diagnose disorders associated with abnormal sleep behavior Intraoperative monitoring  Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring Coagulative necrosisCoagulative necrosis is a type of accidental cell death typically caused by ischemia or infarction  In coagulative necrosis the architecture of dead tissue is preserved for at least a couple of days  It is believed that the injury denatures structural proteins as well as lysosomal enzymes thus blocking the proteolysis of the damaged cells  The lack of lysosomal enzymes allows it to maintain a  coagulated  morphology for some time  Like most types of necrosis if enough viable cells are present around the affected area regeneration will usually occur  Coagulative necrosis can also be induced by high local temperature  it is a desired effect of treatments such as high intensity focused ultrasound applied to cancerous cells Colorectal surgeryColorectal surgery is a field in medicine  dealing with disorders of the rectum  anus  and colon  The field is also known as proctology  but the latter term is now used infrequently within medicine  and is most often employed to identify practices relating to the anus and rectum in particular  The word proctology is derived from the Greek words         proktos  meaning  anus  or  hindparts   and         logia  meaning  science  or  study   Physicians specializing in this field of medicine are called colorectal surgeons or proctologists  In the United States  to become colorectal surgeons  these surgical doctors have to complete a general surgery residency  as well as a colorectal surgery fellowship  upon which they are eligible to be certified in their field of expertise by the American Board of Colon and Rectal Surgery or the American Osteopathic Board of Proctology  In other countries  certification to practice proctology is given to surgeons at the end of a     year subspecialty residency by the country s board of surgery Commonwealth of NationsThe Commonwealth of Nations  formerly the British Commonwealth      also known as simply The Commonwealth  is an intergovernmental organisation of    member states that are mostly former territories of the British Empire  The Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states  organised through the Commonwealth Secretariat and non governmental organisations  organised through the Commonwealth Foundation  The Commonwealth dates back to the mid   th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self governance of its territories  It was formally constituted by the London Declaration in       which established the member states as  free and equal   The symbol of this free association is Queen Elizabeth II who is the Head of the Commonwealth  The Queen is also the monarch of    members of the Commonwealth  known as Commonwealth realms  The other Commonwealth members have different heads of state     members are republics and five are monarchies with a different monarch  Member states have no legal obligation to one another  Instead  they are united by language  history  culture and their shared values of democracy  free speech  human rights  and the rule of law  These values are enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter and promoted by the quadrennial Commonwealth Games  The Commonwealth covers more than            km              sq mi       of the world s land area  and spans all six inhabited continents  With an estimated population of       billion people  nearly a third of the world population  the Commonwealth in      produced a nominal gross domestic product  GDP  of        trillion  representing     of the gross world product when measured nominally and     of the gross world product when measured in purchasing power parity  PPP  CytogeneticsCytogenetics is a branch of genetics that is concerned with how the chromosomes relate to cell behaviour  particularly to their behaviour during mitosis and meiosis  Techniques used include karyotyping  analysis of G banded chromosomes  other cytogenetic banding techniques  as well as molecular cytogenetics such as fluorescent in situ hybridization  FISH  and comparative genomic hybridization  CGH  CytopathologyCytopathology  from Greek        kytos   a hollow          pathos   fate  harm   and          logia  is a branch of pathology that studies and diagnoses diseases on the cellular level  The discipline was founded by George Nicolas Papanicolaou in       A common application of cytopathology is the Pap smear  used as a screening tool  to detect precancerous cervical lesions and prevent cervical cancer  Cytopathology is also commonly used to investigate thyroid lesions  diseases involving sterile body cavities  peritoneal  pleural  and cerebrospinal   and a wide range of other body sites  It is usually used to aid in the diagnosis of cancer  but also helps in the diagnosis of certain infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions  Cytopathology is generally used on samples of free cells or tissue fragments  in contrast to histopathology  which studies whole tissues  Cytopathologic tests are sometimes called smear tests because the samples may be smeared across a glass microscope slide for subsequent staining and microscopic examination  However  cytology samples may be prepared in other ways  including cytocentrifugation  Different types of smear tests may also be used for cancer diagnosis  In this sense  it is termed a cytologic smear  Cytopathology is frequently  less precisely  called cytology  which means  the study of cells  DentistryDentistry is a branch of medicine that is involved in the study  diagnosis  prevention  and treatment of diseases  disorders and conditions of the oral cavity  commonly in the dentition but also the oral mucosa  and of adjacent and related structures and tissues  particularly in the maxillofacial  jaw and facial  area  Although primarily associated with teeth among the general public  the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temperomandibular and other supporting structures  The term dentistry comes from odontology  from Ancient Greek        odo s   tooth      the study of the structure  development  and abnormalities of the teeth  Because of their substantial overlap in concept  dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology  the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases  for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions  Dentistry is important to one s overall health  Dental treatments are carried out by the dental team  which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries  dental assistants  dental hygienists  dental technicians  as well as dental therapists   Most dentists either work in private practices  primary care   dental hospitals or  secondary care  institutions  prisons  armed forces bases  etc    The history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization with the earliest evidence dating from      BC  Remains from the early Harappan periods of the Indus Valley Civilization  c       BC  show evidence of teeth having been drilled dating back       years  It is thought that dental surgery was the first specialization from medicine United States Department of Health and Human ServicesThe United States Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   also known as the Health Department  is a cabinet level department of the U S  federal government with the goal of protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services  Its motto is  Improving the health  safety  and well being of America   Before the separate federal Department of Education was created in       it was called the Department of Health  Education  and Welfare  HEW  DermatologyDermatology is the branch of medicine dealing with the skin  nails  hair and its diseases  It is a specialty with both medical and surgical aspects  A dermatologist treats diseases  in the widest sense  and some cosmetic problems of the skin  scalp  hair  and nails DiagnosisDiagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon  Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines with variations in the use of logic  analytics  and experience to determine  cause and effect   In systems engineering and computer science  it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms  mitigations  and solutions ImmunoassayAn immunoassay is a biochemical test that measures the presence or concentration of a macromolecule or a small molecule in a solution through the use of an antibody  usually  or an antigen  sometimes   The molecule detected by the immunoassay is often referred to as an  analyte  and is in many cases a protein  although it may be other kinds of molecules  of different size and types  as long as the proper antibodies that have the adequate properties for the assay are developed  Analytes in biological liquids such as serum or urine are frequently measured using immunoassays for medical and research purposes  Immunoassays come in many different formats and variations  Immunoassays may be run in multiple steps with reagents being added and washed away or separated at different points in the assay  Multi step assays are often called separation immunoassays or heterogeneous immunoassays  Some immunoassays can be carried out simply by mixing the reagents and sample and making a physical measurement  Such assays are called homogenous immunoassays or less frequently non separation immunoassays  The use of a calibrator is often employed in immunoassays  Calibrators are solutions that are known to contain the analyte in question  and the concentration of that analyte is generally known  Comparison of an assay s response to a real sample against the assay s response produced by the calibrators makes it possible to interpret the signal strength in terms of the presence or concentration of analyte in the sample Disaster medicineDisaster medicine is the area of medical specialization serving the dual areas of providing health care to disaster survivors and providing medically related disaster preparation  disaster planning  disaster response and disaster recovery leadership throughout the disaster life cycle  Disaster medicine specialists provide insight  guidance and expertise on the principles and practice of medicine both in the disaster impact area and healthcare evacuation receiving facilities to emergency management professionals  hospitals  healthcare facilities  communities and governments  The disaster medicine specialist is the liaison between and partner to the medical contingency planner  the emergency management professional  the incident command system  government and policy makers  Disaster medicine is unique among the medical specialties in that unlike all other areas of specialization  the disaster medicine specialist does not practice the full scope of the specialty everyday but only in emergencies  Indeed  the disaster medicine specialist hopes to never practice the full scope of skills required for board certification  However  like the specialists in public health  environmental medicine and occupational medicine  disaster medicine specialists engage in the development and modification of public and private policy  legislation  disaster planning and disaster recovery  Within the United State of America  the specialty of disaster medicine fulfils the requirements set for by Homeland Security Presidential Directives  HSPD   the National Response Plan  NRP   the National Incident Management System  NIMS   the National Resource Typing System  NRTS  and the NIMS Implementation Plan for Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities DiseaseA disease is a particular abnormal condition  a disorder of a structure or function  that affects part or all of an organism  The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology  Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs  It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens  or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency  or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity  In humans  disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain  dysfunction  distress  social problems  or death to the person afflicted  or similar problems for those in contact with the person  In this broader sense  it sometimes includes injuries  disabilities  disorders  syndromes  infections  isolated symptoms  deviant behaviors  and atypical variations of structure and function  while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories  Diseases can affect people not only physically  but also emotionally  as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person s perspective on life  Death due to disease is called death by natural causes  There are four main types of disease  infectious diseases  deficiency diseases  genetic diseases  both hereditary and non hereditary   and physiological diseases  Diseases can also be classified as communicable and non communicable  The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease  blood flow obstruction   followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections Diving medicineDiving medicine  also called undersea and hyperbaric medicine  UHB   is the diagnosis  treatment and prevention of conditions caused by humans entering the undersea environment  It includes the effects on the body of pressure on gases  the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how relationships of a diver s fitness to dive affect a diver s safety  Hyperbaric medicine is a corollary field associated with diving  since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber is used as a treatment for two of the most significant diving related illnesses  decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism  Diving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving  the prevention of diving disorders  treatment of diving accidents and diving fitness  The field includes the effect of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure on the human body and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety  In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other  both causatively and as complications  Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine  and an important part of diver education Doctor of MedicineThe Doctor of Medicine  Latin  Medicinae Doctor  meaning  teacher of medicine   abbreviated M D   is a terminal medical degree for practitioners of medicine  The meaning of the degree varies between different countries  In countries that follow the United States system  the M D  denotes a first professional graduate degree awarded upon initial graduation from medical school  In countries that follow the tradition of the United Kingdom  the M D  denotes a research doctorate  higher doctorate  honorary doctorate or advanced clinical coursework degree restricted to medical graduates  In those countries  the title of the equivalent first professional degree is Bachelor of Medicine  Bachelor of Surgery Doctor of Osteopathic MedicineDoctor of Osteopathic Medicine  D O   is a professional doctoral degree for physicians and surgeons offered by medical schools in the United States  A D O  degree graduate may become licensed as an osteopathic physician  having equivalent rights  privileges  and responsibilities as a physician who has earned the Doctor of Medicine  M D   degree  D O  physicians are licensed to practice the full scope of medicine and surgery in sixty five countries  and all fifty states in the US  D O  physicians constitute seven percent of all U S  physicians  In       there were more than        osteopathic medical physicians in the United States  One hundred forty one medical schools offer the M D  degree in the United States  Thirty three medical schools offer the D O  degree at forty eight locations in thirty one states  Since       total D O  student enrollment has been increasing yearly  In       more than twenty percent of all medical school enrollment in the United States comprised D O  students  The curricula at osteopathic medical schools are similar to those at M D  granting medical schools  which focus the first two years on the biomedical and clinical sciences  then two years on core clinical training in the clinical specialties  Upon completing medical school  a D O  graduate may enter an internship or residency training program  which may be followed by fellowship training  Some D O  graduates attend the same graduate medical education programs as their M D  counterparts  and then take M D  specialty board exams  while other D O  graduates enter osteopathic programs  and take D O  specialty board examinations  One notable difference between D O  and M D  training is that D O  training adds           hours studying techniques for hands on manipulation of the human musculoskeletal system Doctor of PhilosophyA Doctor of Philosophy  PhD  Ph D   or DPhil  Latin Philosophiae Doctor  is a type of doctoral degree awarded by universities in many countries  Ph D s are awarded for a wide range of programs in the sciences  e g   biology  chemistry  physics  mathematics  etc    engineering  and humanities  e g   history  geography  literature  musicology  etc    among others  The Ph D  is a terminal degree in many fields  The completion of a Ph D  is often a requirement for employment as a university professor  researcher  or scientist in many fields  A clear distinction is made between an  earned doctorate   which is awarded for completion of a course of study and a thesis or dissertation  and an  honorary doctorate   a title granted by a university to a successful or notable person who has not completed doctoral academic work or completed a dissertation at the university  Individuals with an earned doctorate can use the title of  Doctor  with their name and use the post nominal letters  Ph D     PhD  or  DPhil   The requirements to earn a Ph D  degree vary considerably according to the country  institution  and time period  from entry level research degrees to higher doctorates  A person who attains a doctorate of philosophy is automatically awarded the academic title of doctor  During the studies that lead to the degree  the student is called doctoral student or Ph D  student  but also doctoral candidate or Ph D  candidate once the student has completed all of the coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis dissertation  all but dissertation   A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions  A Ph D  candidate must submit a project  thesis or dissertation often consisting of a body of original academic research  which is in principle worthy of publication in a peer reviewed journal  In many countries  a candidate must defend this work before a panel of expert examiners appointed by the university  Universities award other types of doctorates besides the Ph D   such as the Doctor of Musical Arts  D M A    a degree for music performers and the Doctor of Education  Ed D    a degree for professional educators  In       ELIA  European League of the Institutes of the Arts  launched The  Florence Principles  on the Doctorate in the Arts  The Florence Principles relating to the Salzburg Principles and the Salzburg Recommendations of EUA  European University Association  name seven points of attention to specify the Doctorate   Ph D  in the Arts compared to a scientific doctorate   Ph D  The Florence Principles have been endorsed are supported also by AEC  CILECT  CUMULUS and SAR  In the context of academic degrees  the term  philosophy  does not refer solely to the field or academic discipline of philosophy  but is used in a broader sense in accordance with its original Greek meaning  which is  love of wisdom   In most of Europe  all fields  history  philosophy  social sciences  mathematics  and natural philosophy natural sciences  other than theology  law  and medicine  the so called professional  vocational  or technical curriculum  were traditionally known as philosophy  and in Germany and elsewhere in Europe the basic faculty of liberal arts was known as the  faculty of philosophy  Doctor of ScienceFor the degree granted by Soviet institutions  see Doctor of Sciences  Doctor of Science  Latin  Scientiae Doctor   usually abbreviated Sc D   D Sc   S D   D S   or Dr Sc   is an academic research degree awarded in a number of countries throughout the world  In some countries   Doctor of Science  is the title used for the standard doctorate in the sciences  elsewhere the Sc D  is a  higher doctorate  awarded in recognition of a substantial and sustained contribution to scientific knowledge beyond that required for a Ph D  It may also be awarded as an honorary degree DysplasiaDysplasia  from Ancient Greek      dys    bad  or  difficult  and        plasis   formation   is an ambiguous term used in pathology to refer to an abnormality of development or an epithelial anomaly of growth and differentiation  epithelial dysplasia   The terms hip dysplasia  fibrous dysplasia  renal dysplasia refer to an abnormal development  at macroscopic or microscopical level  Myelodysplastic syndromes  or dysplasia of blood forming cells  show increased numbers of immature cells in the bone marrow  and a decrease in mature  functional cells in the blood Electron microscopeAn electron microscope is a microscope that uses a beam of accelerated electrons as a source of illumination  As the wavelength of an electron can be up to         times shorter than that of visible light photons  electron microscopes have a higher resolving power than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects  A transmission electron microscope can achieve better than    pm resolution and magnifications of up to about           x whereas most light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about     nm resolution and useful magnifications below     x  Transmission electron microscopes use electrostatic and electromagnetic lenses to control the electron beam and focus it to form an image  These electron optical lenses are analogous to the glass lenses of an optical light microscope  Electron microscopes are used to investigate the ultrastructure of a wide range of biological and inorganic specimens including microorganisms  cells  large molecules  biopsy samples  metals  and crystals  Industrially  electron microscopes are often used for quality control and failure analysis  Modern electron microscopes produce electron micrographs using specialized digital cameras and frame grabbers to capture the image Emergency medicineEmergency medicine  formerly known in some countries as accident and emergency medicine  is the medical specialty involving care for undifferentiated and unscheduled patients with illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention  In their role as first line providers  emergency physicians are responsible for initiating investigations and interventions to diagnose and or treat patients in the acute phase  including initial resuscitation and stabilization   coordinating care with physicians from other specialities  and making decisions regarding a patient s need for hospital admission  observation  or discharge  Emergency physicians generally practice in hospital emergency departments  pre hospital settings via emergency medical services  and intensive care units  but may also work in primary care settings such as urgent care clinics  Different models for emergency medicine exist internationally  In countries following the Anglo American model  emergency medicine was originally the domain of surgeons  general practitioners  and other generalist physicians  but in recent decades it has become recognised as a speciality in its own right with its own training programmes and academic posts  and the specialty is now a popular choice among medical students and newly qualified medical practitioners  By contrast  in countries following the Franco German model  the speciality does not exist and emergency medical care is instead provided directly by anesthesiologists  for initial resuscitation   surgeons  specialists in internal medicine  or another speciality as appropriate  In developing countries  emergency medicine is still evolving and international emergency medicine programs offer hope of improving basic emergency care where resources are limited EndocrinologyEndocrinology  from Greek        endon   within          kr n    to separate   and          logia  is a branch of biology and medicine dealing with the endocrine system  its diseases  and its specific secretions known as hormones  It is also concerned with the integration of developmental events proliferation  growth  and differentiation  and the psychological or behavioral activities of metabolism  growth and development  tissue function  sleep  digestion  respiration  excretion  mood  stress  lactation  movement  reproduction  and sensory perception caused by hormones  Specializations include behavioral endocrinology and comparative endocrinology  The endocrine system consists of several glands  all in different parts of the body  that secrete hormones directly into the blood rather than into a duct system  Hormones have many different functions and modes of action  one hormone may have several effects on different target organs  and  conversely  one target organ may be affected by more than one hormone Enzyme assayEnzyme assays are laboratory methods for measuring enzymatic activity  They are vital for the study of enzyme kinetics and enzyme inhibition Etiology  medicine Etiology   i ti  l d i   alternative spelling aetiology  is the study of causation  or origination  The word is derived from the Greek             aitiologia   giving a reason for          aitia   cause   and          logia  EuropeEurope is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia  Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north  the Atlantic Ocean to the west  and the Mediterranean Sea to the south  The eastern boundary with Asia is a historical and cultural construct  as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them  Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains  the Ural River  the Caspian and Black Seas  and the waterways of the Turkish Straits  Yet the non oceanic borders of Europe a concept dating back to classical antiquity are arbitrary  The primarily physiographic term  continent  as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent s current overland boundaries  Europe covers about            square kilometres            sq mi   or    of the Earth s surface       of land area   Politically  Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which the Russian Federation is the largest and most populous  spanning     of the continent and comprising     of its population  Europe had a total population of about     million  about     of world population  as of       The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent  even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe  Further from the sea  seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast  Europe  in particular ancient Greece  was the birthplace of Western civilization  The fall of the Western Roman Empire  during the migration period  marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the Middle Ages  Renaissance humanism  exploration  art  and science led to the modern era  From the Age of Discovery onwards  Europe played a predominant role in global affairs  Between the   th and   th centuries  European powers controlled at various times the Americas  most of Africa  Oceania  and the majority of Asia  The Industrial Revolution  which began in Great Britain at the end of the   th century  gave rise to radical economic  cultural  and social change in Western Europe  and eventually the wider world  Both world wars took place for the most part in Europe  contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid   th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence  During the Cold War  Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east  until the revolutions of      and fall of the Berlin Wall  In       the Council of Europe was formed following a speech by Sir Winston Churchill  with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals  It includes all states except for Belarus  Kazakhstan and Vatican City  Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union  a separate political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation  The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in       The currency of most countries of the European Union  the euro  is the most commonly used among Europeans  and the EU s Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states  The European Anthem is  Ode to Joy  and states celebrate peace and unity on Europe Day Eye surgeryEye surgery  also known as ocular surgery  is surgery performed on the eye or its adnexa  typically by an ophthalmologist  The eye is a fragile organ  and requires extreme care before  during  and after a surgical procedure  An expert eye surgeon is responsible for selecting the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient  and for taking the necessary safety precautions Family medicineFamily medicine  FM   formerly family practice  FP   is a specialty devoted to comprehensive health care for people of all ages  the specialist is named a family physician or family doctor  In Europe the discipline is often referred to as general practice and a practitioner as a General Practice Doctor or GP  this name emphasises the holistic nature of this speciality  as well as its roots in the family  It is a division of primary care that provides continuing and comprehensive health care for the individual and family across all ages  genders  diseases  and parts of the body  It is based on knowledge of the patient in the context of the family and the community  emphasizing disease prevention and health promotion  According to the World Organization of Family Doctors  WONCA   the aim of family medicine is to provide personal  comprehensive  and continuing care for the individual in the context of the family and the community  The issues of values underlying this practice are usually known as primary care ethics Fat necrosisFat necrosis is a form of necrosis characterized by the action upon fat by digestive enzymes  In fat necrosis the enzyme lipase releases fatty acids from triglycerides  The fatty acids then complex with calcium to form soaps  These soaps appear as white chalky deposits  It is usually associated with trauma of the pancreas or acute pancreatitis  It can also occur in the breast  the salivary glands     and neonates after a traumatic delivery Fibrinoid necrosisFibrinoid necrosis is a form of necrosis  or tissue death  in which there is accumulation of amorphous  basic  proteinaceous material in the tissue matrix with a staining pattern reminiscent of fibrin  It is associated with conditions such as immune vasculitis  e g  polyarteritis nodosa   malignant hypertension  preeclampsia  or hyperacute transplant rejection  In small vessel vasculitis  fibrin plugs frequently occur in the vessel lumen  but the term fibrinoid is usually used to refer to material outside the lumen of a vessel  Fibrinoid necrosis also occurs in the walls of arterioles in malignant hypertension  blood pressure greater than         mmHg   Fibrinoid necrosis is a special form of necrosis usually seen in immune reactions involving blood vessels  known as Type III hypersensitivity reactions  This pattern of necrosis typically occurs when complexes of antigens and antibodies are deposited in the walls of arteries  Deposits of these immune complexes  together with fibrin that has leaked out of vessels  result in a bright pink and amorphous appearance in H E stains  called  fibrinoid   fibrin like  by pathologists  Ultimately  in the living patient most necrotic cells and their contents disappear by phagocytosis of the debris and enzymatic digestion by leukocytes  If necrotic cells and cellular debris are not promptly destroyed and reabsorbed  they tend to attract calcium salts and other minerals and to become calcified  Common sites undergoing fibrinoid necrosis are  SLE  Aschoff bodies seen in rheumatic heart disease  Arthus reaction  serum sickness  polyarteritis nodosa  poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis  hyperacutely rejected grafts  malignant hypertension           mm Hg  Flow cytometryIn biotechnology  flow cytometry is a laser  or impedance based  biophysical technology employed in cell counting  cell sorting  biomarker detection and protein engineering  by suspending cells in a stream of fluid and passing them by an electronic detection apparatus  It allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical and chemical characteristics of up to thousands of particles per second  Flow cytometry is routinely used in the diagnosis of health disorders  especially blood cancers  but has many other applications in basic research  clinical practice and clinical trials  A common variation is to physically sort particles based on their properties  so as to purify populations of interest Fluorescence in situ hybridizationFluorescence in situ hybridization  FISH  is a cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent probes that bind to only those parts of the chromosome with a high degree of sequence complementarity  It was developed by biomedical researchers in the early     s and is used to detect and localize the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences on chromosomes  Fluorescence microscopy can be used to find out where the fluorescent probe is bound to the chromosomes  FISH is often used for finding specific features in DNA for use in genetic counseling  medicine  and species identification  FISH can also be used to detect and localize specific RNA targets  mRNA  lncRNA and miRNA  in cells  circulating tumor cells  and tissue samples  In this context  it can help define the spatial temporal patterns of gene expression within cells and tissues Forensic pathologyForensic pathology is pathology that focuses on determining the cause of death by examining a corpse  A post mortem is performed by a medical examiner  usually during the investigation of criminal law cases and civil law cases in some jurisdictions  Coroners and medical examiners are also frequently asked to confirm the identity of a corpse  Also see forensic medicine GangreneGangrene  or gangrenous necrosis  is a type of necrosis caused by a critically insufficient blood supply  This potentially life threatening condition may occur after an injury or infection  or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation  The primary cause of gangrene is reduced blood supply to the affected tissues  which results in cell death  Diabetes and long term smoking increase the risk of suffering from gangrene  Gangrene is not a communicable disease  it does not spread from person to person  though the infection associated to some forms can  The types of gangrene differ in symptoms  and include dry gangrene  wet gangrene  gas gangrene  internal gangrene  and necrotizing fasciitis  Surgical removal of gangrenous tissue and antibiotics are the mainstays of treatment for gangrene  After the gangrene is treated  the underlying cause is addressed  This includes lifestyle modification such as smoking cessation  better control of diabetes  revascularization or  rarely  medical therapy to stop vascular spasm or the production of cold induced vascular obstruction by cold precipitated cryoglobulins GastroenterologyGastroenterology  MeSH heading  is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system and its disorders  Diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract  which include the organs from mouth to anus  along the alimentary canal  are the focus of this speciality  Physicians practicing in this field are called gastroenterologists  They have usually completed about eight years of pre medical and medical education  a year long internship  if this is not a part of the residency   three years of an internal medicine residency  and two to three years in the gastroenterology fellowship  Gastroenterologists perform a number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including colonoscopy  endoscopy  endoscopic retrograde cholangiancreatography  ERCP   endoscopic ultrasound and liver biopsy  Some gastroenterology trainees will complete a  fourth year   although this is often their seventh year of graduate medical education  in transplant hepatology  advanced endoscopy  inflammatory bowel disease  motility or other topics  Hepatology  or hepatobiliary medicine  encompasses the study of the liver  pancreas  and biliary tree  while proctology emcompasses the fields of anus and rectum diseases  They are traditionally considered sub specialties of gastroenterology PathologyPathology  from the Greek roots of pathos          meaning  experience  or  suffering   and  logia            study of   is a significant component of the causal study of disease and a major field in modern medicine and diagnosis  The term pathology itself may be used broadly to refer to the study of disease in general  incorporating a wide range of bioscience research fields and medical practices  including plant pathology and veterinary pathology   or more narrowly to describe work within the contemporary medical field of  general pathology   which includes a number of distinct but inter related medical specialties that diagnose disease mostly through analysis of tissue  cell  and body fluid samples  Used as a count noun   a pathology   plural   pathologies   can also refer to the predicted or actual progression of particular diseases  as in the statement  the many different forms of cancer have diverse pathologies    and the affix path is sometimes used to indicate a state of disease in cases of both physical ailment  as in cardiomyopathy  and psychological conditions  such as psychopathy   Similarly  a pathological condition is one caused by disease  rather than occurring physiologically  A physician practicing pathology is called a pathologist  As a field of general inquiry and research  pathology addresses four components of disease  cause etiology  mechanisms of development  pathogenesis   structural alterations of cells  morphologic changes   and the consequences of changes  clinical manifestations   In common medical practice  general pathology is mostly concerned with analyzing known clinical abnormalities that are markers or precursors for both infectious and non infectious disease and is conducted by experts in one of two major specialties  anatomical pathology and clinical pathology  Further divisions in specialty exist on the basis of the involved sample types  comparing  for example  cytopathology  hematopathology  and histopathology   organs  as in renal pathology   and physiological systems  oral pathology   as well as on the basis of the focus of the examination  as with forensic pathology   The sense of the word pathology as a synonym of disease or pathosis is very common in health care  The persistence of this usage despite attempted proscription is discussed elsewhere General practitionerIn the medical profession  a general practitioner  GP  is a medical doctor who treats acute and chronic illnesses and provides preventive care and health education to patients  A general practitioner manages types of illness that present in an undifferentiated way at an early stage of development  which may require urgent intervention  The holistic approach of general practice aims to take into consideration the biological  psychological  and social factors relevant to the care of each patient s illness  Their duties are not confined to specific organs of the body  and they have particular skills in treating people with multiple health issues  They are trained to treat patients of any age and sex to levels of complexity that vary between countries  The role of a GP can vary greatly between  or even within  countries  In urban areas of developed countries their roles tend to be narrower and focused on the care of chronic health problems  the treatment of acute non life threatening diseases  the early detection and referral to specialized care of patients with serious diseases  and preventative care including health education and immunization  Meanwhile  in rural areas of developed countries or in developing countries a GP may be routinely involved in pre hospital emergency care  the delivery of babies  community hospital care and performing low complexity surgical procedures  In some healthcare systems GPs work in primary care centers where they play a central role in the healthcare team  while in other models of care GPs can work as single handed practitioners  The term general practitioner or GP is common in the Republic of Ireland  the United Kingdom and several Commonwealth countries  In these countries the word physician is largely reserved for certain other types of medical specialists  notably in internal medicine  While in these countries  the term GP has a clearly defined meaning  in North America the term has become somewhat ambiguous  and is not necessarily synonymous with the term  family doctor  or primary care provider  as described below   Historically  the role of a GP was once performed by any doctor qualified in a medical school working in the community  However  since the     s general practice has become a specialty in its own right  with specific training requirements tailored to each country  The Alma Ata Declaration in      set the intellectual foundation of what primary care and general practice is nowadays General surgeryGeneral surgery is a surgical specialty that focuses on abdominal contents including esophagus  stomach  small bowel  colon  liver  pancreas  gallbladder and bile ducts  and often the thyroid gland  depending on local reference patterns   They also deal with diseases involving the skin  breast  soft tissue  trauma  peripheral vascular surgery and hernias GeriatricsGeriatrics or geriatric medicine is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people  It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults  There is no set age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician or geriatric physician  a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people  Rather  this decision is determined by the individual patient s needs  and the availability of a specialist  It is important to note the difference between geriatrics  the care of aged people  and gerontology  which is the study of the aging process itself  The term geriatrics comes from the Greek       geron meaning  old man   and        iatros meaning  healer   However  geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology Glandular metaplasiaGlandular metaplasia is a type of metaplasia where irritated tissue converts to a glandular form  An example occurs in the esophagus  where tissue becomes more similar to the tissue of the stomach  Another example occurs in the urinary bladder Gram stainingGram staining or Gram stain  also called Gram s method  is a method of staining used to differentiate bacterial species into two large groups  gram positive and gram negative   The name comes from the Danish bacteriologist Hans Christian Gram  who developed the technique  Gram staining differentiates bacteria by the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls by detecting peptidoglycan  which is present in the cell wall of Gram positive bacteria  Gram positive bacteria retain the crystal violet dye  and thus are stained violet  while the Gram negative bacteria do not  after washing  a counterstain is added  commonly safranin or fuchsine  that will stain these Gram negative bacteria a pink color  Both Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative bacteria pick up the counterstain  The counterstain  however  is unseen on Gram positive bacteria because of the darker crystal violet stain  The Gram stain is almost always the first step in the preliminary identification of a bacterial organism  While Gram staining is a valuable diagnostic tool in both clinical and research settings  not all bacteria can be definitively classified by this technique  This gives rise to gram variable and gram indeterminate groups Gross examinationGross examination or  grossing  is the process by which pathology specimens are inspected with the bare eye to obtain diagnostic information  while being processed for further microscopic examination  Gross examination of surgical specimens is typically performed by a pathologist  or by a pathologists  assistant working within a pathology practice  Individuals trained in these fields are often able to gather diagnostically critical information in this stage of processing  including the stage and margin status of surgically removed tumors  The initial step in any examination of a clinical specimen is confirmation of the identity of the patient and the anatomical site from which the specimen was obtained  Sufficient clinical data should be communicated by the clinical team to the pathology team in order to guide the appropriate diagnostic examination and interpretation of the specimen   if such information is not provided  it must be obtained by the examiner prior to processing the specimen  There are usually two end products of the gross examination of a surgical specimen  The first is the gross description  a document which serves as the written record of the examiner s findings  and is included in the final pathology report  The second product is a set of tissue blocks  typically postage stamp sized portions of tissue sealed in plastic cassettes  which will be processed into slides for microscopic examination  Since only a minority of the tissue from a large specimen can reasonably be subject to microscopic examination  the success of the final histological diagnosis is highly dependent on the skill of the professional performing the gross examination  The gross examiner may sample portions of the specimen for other types of ancillary tests as diagnostically indicated  these include microbiological culture  flow cytometry  cytogenetics  or electron microscopy GynaecologyGynaecology or gynecology  see spelling differences  is the medical practice dealing with the health of the female reproductive systems  vagina  uterus  and ovaries  and the breasts  Literally  outside medicine  the term means  the science of women   Its counterpart is andrology  which deals with medical issues specific to the male reproductive system  Almost all modern gynaecologists are also obstetricians  see obstetrics and gynaecology   In many areas  the specialities of gynaecology and obstetrics overlap Gynecologic Oncology  journal Gynecologic Oncology is a peer reviewed medical journal covering all aspects of gynecologic oncology  The journal covers investigations relating to the etiology  diagnosis  and treatment of female cancers  as well as research from any of the disciplines related to this field of interest  It is published by Elsevier and is the official journal of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology Hand surgeryThe field of hand surgery deals with both surgical and non surgical treatment of conditions and problems that may take place in the hand or upper extremity  commonly from the tip of the hand to the shoulder  including injury and infection  Hand surgery may be practiced by graduates of general surgery  orthopedic surgery and plastic surgery  More formally  chiroplasty  or cheiroplasty  is a term which refers to plastic surgery of the hands  The term combines root word  chir o    which means  hand   and the suffix   plasty   which means  surgical repair   Plastic surgeons and orthopedic surgeons receive significant training in hand surgery during their residency training  with some graduates going on to do an additional one year hand fellowship  Board certified general  plastic  or orthopedics surgeons who have completed approved fellowship training in hand surgery and have met a number of other practice requirements are qualified to take the  Certificate of Added Qualifications in Surgery of the Hand  examination  formerly known as the CAQSH  it is now known as the SOTH   Regardless of their original field of training  once candidates have completed an approved fellowship in hand surgery  all hand surgeons have received training in treating all injuries both to the bones and soft tissues of the hand and upper extremity  Among those without additional hand training  Plastic surgeons have usually received training to handle traumatic hand and digit amputations that require a  replant  operation  Orthopedic surgeons are trained to reconstruct all aspects to salvage the appendage  tendons  muscle  bone  Orthopedic surgeons are trained to handle complex fractures of the hand and injuries to the carpal bones that alter the mechanics of the wrist HematologyHematology  also spelled haematology  from the Greek       haima  blood   and   o      is the branch of medicine concerned with the study  diagnosis  treatment  and prevention of diseases related to blood  Hematology includes the study of etiology  It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components  such as blood cells  hemoglobin  blood proteins  bone marrow  platelets  blood vessels  spleen  and the mechanism of coagulation  Such diseases might include hemophilia  blood clots  other bleeding disorders and blood cancers such as leukemia  myeloma  and lymphoma  The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist  Many hematologists work as hematologist oncologists  also providing medical treatment for all types of cancer HematopathologyHematopathology or hemopathology is the branch of pathology which studies diseases of hematopoietic cells  In the United States  hematopathology is a board certified subspecialty  American Board of Pathology  practiced by those physicians who have completed general pathology residency  anatomic  clinical  or combined  HemodynamicsHemodynamics or h modynamics is the dynamics of blood flow  The circulatory system is controlled by homeostatic mechanisms  much as hydraulic circuits are controlled by control systems  Hemodynamic response continuously monitors and adjusts to conditions in the body and its environment  Thus hemodynamics explains the physical laws that govern the flow of blood in the blood vessels  Blood flow ensures the transportation of nutrients  hormones  metabolic wastes  O  and CO  throughout the body to maintain cell level metabolism  the regulation of the pH  osmotic pressure and temperature of the whole body  and the protection from microbial and mechanical harms  Blood is a non Newtonian fluid  best studied using rheology rather than hydrodynamics  Blood vessels are not rigid tubes  so classic hydrodynamics and fluids mechanics based on the use of classical viscometers are not capable of explaining hemodynamics HemosiderinHemosiderin or haemosiderin is an iron storage complex  It is only found within cells  as opposed to circulating in blood  and appears to be a complex of ferritin  denatured ferritin and other material  The iron within deposits of hemosiderin is very poorly available to supply iron when needed  Hemosiderin can be identified histologically with  Perls  Prussian blue  stain  In normal animals  hemosiderin deposits are small and commonly inapparent without special stains  Excessive accumulation of hemosiderin is usually detected within cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system  MPS  or occasionally within epithelial cells of liver and kidney  Several disease processes result in deposition of larger amounts of hemosiderin in tissues  although these deposits often cause no symptoms  they can lead to organ damage  Hemosiderin is most commonly found in macrophages and is especially abundant in situations following hemorrhage  suggesting that its formation may be related to phagocytosis of red blood cells and hemoglobin  Hemosiderin can accumulate in different organs in various diseases  Iron is required by many of the chemical reactions  i e  oxidation reduction reactions  in the body but is toxic when not properly contained  Thus  many methods of iron storage have developed HepatologyHepatology is the branch of medicine that incorporates the study of liver  gallbladder  biliary tree  and pancreas as well as management of their disorders  Although traditionally considered a sub specialty of gastroenterology  rapid expansion has led in some countries to doctors specializing solely on this area  who are called hepatologists  Diseases and complications related to viral hepatitis and alcohol are the main reason for seeking specialist advice  More than two billion people have been infected with hepatitis B virus at some point in their life  and approximately     million have become persistent carriers  Up to     of liver cancers can be attributed to either hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus  In terms of mortality  the former is second only to smoking among known agents causing cancer  With more widespread implementation of vaccination and strict screening before blood transfusion  lower infection rates are expected in the future  In many countries  though  overall alcohol consumption is increasing  and consequently the number of people with cirrhosis and other related complications is commensurately increasing HistopathologyHistopathology  compound of three Greek words        histos  tissue         pathos  suffering   and         logia  study of   refers to the microscopic examination of tissue in order to study the manifestations of disease  Specifically  in clinical medicine  histopathology refers to the examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist  after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides  In contrast  cytopathology examines free cells or tissue fragments History of medicineThe history of medicine  as practiced by trained professionals  shows how societies have changed in their approach to illness and disease from ancient times to the present  Early medical traditions include those of Babylon  China  Egypt  Greece and India  The Greeks introduced the concepts of medical diagnosis  prognosis  and advanced medical ethics  The Hippocratic Oath  still taken  although significantly changed from the original  by doctors up to today  was written in Greece in the  th century BCE  In the medieval age  surgical practices inherited from the ancient masters were improved and then systematized in Rogerius s The Practice of Surgery  Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years      in Italy  During the Renaissance  understanding of anatomy improved  and the microscope was invented  The germ theory of disease in the   th century led to cures for many infectious diseases  Military doctors advanced the methods of trauma treatment and surgery  Public health measures were developed especially in the   th century as the rapid growth of cities required systematic sanitary measures  Advanced research centers opened in the early   th century  often connected with major hospitals  The mid   th century was characterized by new biological treatments  such as antibiotics  These advancements  along with developments in chemistry  genetics  and lab technology  such as the x ray  led to modern medicine  Medicine was heavily professionalized in the   th century  and new careers opened to women as nurses  from the     s  and as physicians  especially after        The   st century is characterized by highly advanced research involving numerous fields of science Hospital medicineHospital medicine in the United States is the medical specialty concerned with the care of acutely ill hospitalized patients  Physicians whose primary professional focus is caring for hospitalized patients only while they are in the hospital are called hospitalists  This type of medical practice has extended beyond the US into Canada  The term hospitalist was first coined by Robert Wachter and Lee Goldman in a      New England Journal of Medicine article  The scope of hospital medicine includes acute patient care  teaching  research  and executive leadership related to the delivery of hospital based care  Hospital medicine  like emergency medicine  is a specialty organized around a site of care  the hospital   rather than an organ  like cardiology   a disease  like oncology   or a patient s age  like pediatrics   The emergence of hospital medicine has both similarities with and differences from acute medicine in the United Kingdom  reflecting health system differences HyperplasiaHyperplasia  from ancient Greek      huper   over           plasis   formation    or hypergenesis  is an increase in the amount of organic tissue that results from cell proliferation  It may lead to the gross enlargement of an organ and the term is sometimes confused with benign neoplasia or benign tumor  Hyperplasia is a common preneoplastic response to stimulus  Microscopically  cells resemble normal cells but are increased in numbers  Sometimes cells may also be increased in size  hypertrophy   Hyperplasia is different from hypertrophy in that the adaptive cell change in hypertrophy is an increase in the size of cells  whereas hyperplasia involves an increase in the number of cells HypertrophyHypertrophy  IPA  ha  p  tr fi   from Greek       excess           nourishment   is the increase in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component cells  It is distinguished from hyperplasia  in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number  Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes  they frequently occur together  such as in the case of the hormonally induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy  Eccentric hypertrophy is a type of hypertrophy where the walls and chamber of a hollow organ undergo growth in which the overall size and volume are enlarged  It is applied especially to the left ventricle of heart  Sarcomeres are added in series  as for example in dilated cardiomyopathy  in contrast to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  a type of concentric hypertrophy  where sarcomeres are added in parallel  ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence is a technique used for light microscopy with a fluorescence microscope and is used primarily on microbiological samples  This technique uses the specificity of antibodies to their antigen to target fluorescent dyes to specific biomolecule targets within a cell  and therefore allows visualization of the distribution of the target molecule through the sample  The binding of the fluorophore cannot interfere with the immunological specificity of the antibody or the binding capacity of its antigen  Immunofluorescence is a widely used example of immunostaining  using antibodies to stain proteins  and is a specific example of immunohistochemistry  the use of the antibody antigen relationship in tissues   This technique primarily makes use of fluorophores to visualise the location of the antibodies  Immunofluorescence can be used on tissue sections  cultured cell lines  or individual cells  and may be used to analyze the distribution of proteins  glycans  and small biological and non biological molecules  This technique can even be used to visualize structures such as intermediate sized filaments  Immunoflourescence can also be used as a  semi quantitative  method to gain insight into the levels and localization patterns of DNA methlyation since it is a more time consuming method than true quantitatvie methods and there is some subjectivity in the analysis of the levels of methylation  Immunofluoresence can be used in combination with other  non antibody methods of fluorescent staining  for example  use of DAPI to label DNA  Several microscope designs can be used for analysis of immunofluorescence samples  the simplest is the epifluorescence microscope  and the confocal microscope is also widely used  Various super resolution microscope designs that are capable of much higher resolution can also be used ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemistry  IHC  refers to the process of selectively imaging antigens  e g  proteins  in cells of a tissue section by exploiting the principle of antibodies binding specifically to antigens in biological tissues  IHC takes its name from the roots  immuno   in reference to antibodies used in the procedure  and  histo   meaning tissue  compare to immunocytochemistry   The procedure was conceptualized and first implemented by Albert Coons in       Immunohistochemical staining is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancerous tumors  Specific molecular markers are characteristic of particular cellular events such as proliferation or cell death  apoptosis   Immunohistochemistry is also widely used in basic research to understand the distribution and localization of biomarkers and differentially expressed proteins in different parts of a biological tissue  Visualising an antibody antigen interaction can be accomplished in a number of ways  In the most common instance  an antibody is conjugated to an enzyme  such as peroxidase  that can catalyse a colour producing reaction  see immunoperoxidase staining   Alternatively  the antibody can also be tagged to a fluorophore  such as fluorescein or rhodamine  see immunofluorescence  ImmunologyImmunology is a branch of biology that covers the study of immune systems in all organisms  It was the Russian biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov who boosted studies on immunology  and received the Nobel Prize in      for his work  He jabbed the thorn of a rose on a starfish and noted that     hours later  cells were surrounding the tip  It was an active response of the body  trying to maintain its integrity  It was Mechnikov who first observed the phenomenon of phagocytosis  in which the body defends itself against a foreign body  and coined the term  It charts  measures  and contextualizes the  physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases  malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders  such as autoimmune diseases  hypersensitivities  immune deficiency  and transplant rejection   the physical  chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system in vitro  in situ  and in vivo  Immunology has applications in numerous disciplines of medicine  particularly in the fields of organ transplantation  oncology  virology  bacteriology  parasitology  psychiatry  and dermatology  Prior to the designation of immunity from the etymological root immunis  which is Latin for  exempt   early physicians characterized organs that would later be proven as essential components of the immune system  The important lymphoid organs of the immune system are the thymus and bone marrow  and chief lymphatic tissues such as spleen  tonsils  lymph vessels  lymph nodes  adenoids  and liver  When health conditions worsen to emergency status  portions of immune system organs including the thymus  spleen  bone marrow  lymph nodes and other lymphatic tissues can be surgically excised for examination while patients are still alive  Many components of the immune system are typically cellular in nature and not associated with any specific organ  but rather are embedded or circulating in various tissues located throughout the body ImmunopathologyImmunopathology is a branch of medicine that deals with immune responses associated with disease  It includes the study of the pathology of an organism  organ system  or disease with respect to the immune system  immunity  and immune responses  In biology  it refers to damage caused to an organism by its own immune response  as a result of an infection  It could be due to mismatch between pathogen and host species  and often occurs when an animal pathogen infects a human  e g  avian flu leads to a cytokine storm which contributes to the increased mortality rate  InfectionInfection is the invasion of an organism s body tissues by disease causing agents  their multiplication  and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce  Infectious disease  also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease  is illness resulting from an infection  Infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses  viroids  prions  bacteria  nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms  arthropods such as ticks  mites  fleas  and lice  fungi such as ringworm  and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths  Hosts can fight infections using their immune system  Mammalian hosts react to infections with an innate response  often involving inflammation  followed by an adaptive response  Specific medications used to treat infections include antibiotics  antivirals  antifungals  antiprotozoals  and antihelminthics  Infectious diseases resulted in     million deaths in       about     of all deaths   The branch of medicine that focuses on infections is referred to as infectious disease Infectious disease  medical specialty Infectious disease  also known as infectious diseases  infectious medicine  infectious disease medicine or infectiology  is a medical specialty dealing with the diagnosis  control and treatment of infections  An infectious disease  ID  specialist s practice may consist largely of managing nosocomial  hospital acquired  infections  or it may be out patient based InflammationInflammation  from Latin inflammatio  is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli  such as pathogens  damaged cells  or irritants  and is a protective response involving immune cells  blood vessels  and molecular mediators  The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury  clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process  and to initiate tissue repair  The classical signs of inflammation are heat  pain  redness  swelling  and loss of function  Inflammation is a generic response  and therefore it is considered as a mechanism of innate immunity  as compared to adaptive immunity  which is specific for each pathogen  Too little inflammation could lead to progressive tissue destruction by the harmful stimulus  e g  bacteria  and compromise the survival of the organism  In contrast  chronic inflammation may lead to a host of diseases  such as hay fever  periodontitis  atherosclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis  and even cancer  e g   gallbladder carcinoma   Inflammation is therefore normally closely regulated by the body  Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic  Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes  especially granulocytes  from the blood into the injured tissues  A series of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response  involving the local vascular system  the immune system  and various cells within the injured tissue  Prolonged inflammation  known as chronic inflammation  leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation  such as mononuclear cells  and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue from the inflammatory process  Inflammation is not a synonym for infection  Infection describes the interaction between the action of microbial invasion and the reaction of the body s inflammatory response   the two components are considered together when discussing an infection  and the word is used to imply a microbial invasive cause for the observed inflammatory reaction  Inflammation on the other hand describes purely the body s immunovascular response  whatever the cause may be  But because of how often the two are correlated  words ending in the suffix  itis  which refers to inflammation  are sometimes informally described as referring to infection  For example  the word urethritis strictly means only  urethral inflammation   but clinical health care providers usually discuss urethritis as a urethral infection because urethral microbial invasion is the most common cause of urethritis  It is useful to differentiate inflammation and infection as there are many pathological situations where inflammation is not driven by microbial invasion   for example  atherosclerosis  type III hypersensitivity  trauma  ischaemia  There are also pathological situations where microbial invasion does not result in classic inflammatory response for example  parasitosis  eosinophilia Integrated Authority FileThe Integrated Authority File  German  Gemeinsame Normdatei  also known as  Universal Authority File  or GND is an international authority file for the organisation of personal names  subject headings and corporate bodies from catalogues  It is used mainly for documentation in libraries and increasingly also by archives and museums  The GND is managed by the German National Library  German  Deutsche Nationalbibliothek  DNB  in cooperation with various regional library networks in German speaking Europe and other partners  The GND falls under the Creative Commons Zero  CC   license  The GND specification provides a hierarchy of high level entities and sub classes  useful in library classification  and an approach to unambiguous identification of single elements  It also comprises an ontology intended for knowledge representation in the semantic web  available in the RDF format  The Integrated Authority File became operational in April      and integrates the content of the following authority files which have since been discontinued  Name Authority File  German  Personennamendatei  PND

names Intensive care medicineIntensive care medicine or critical care medicine is a branch of medicine concerned with the diagnosis and management of life threatening conditions requiring sophisticated organ support and invasive monitoring Internal medicineInternal medicine or general medicine  in Commonwealth nations  is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention  diagnosis  and treatment of adult diseases  Physicians specializing in internal medicine are called internists  or physicians  without a modifier  in Commonwealth nations  Internists are skilled in the management of patients who have undifferentiated or multi system disease processes  Internists care for hospitalized and ambulatory patients and may play a major role in teaching and research  Because internal medicine patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations  internists do much of their work in hospitals  Internists often have subspecialty interests in diseases affecting particular organs or organ systems  Internal medicine is also a specialty within clinical pharmacy and veterinary medicine Interventional radiologyInterventional radiology  IR   sometimes known as vascular and interventional radiology  VIR   is a medical sub specialty which provides minimally invasive image guided diagnosis and treatment of disease  Although the range of procedures performed by interventional radiologists is broad  the unifying concept behind these procedures is the application of image guidance and minimally invasive techniques in order to minimize risk to the patient  As the inventors of angioplasty and the catheter delivered stent  interventional radiologists pioneered modern minimally invasive medicine  Using X rays  CT  ultrasound  MRI  and other imaging modalities  interventional radiologists obtain images which are then used to direct interventional instruments throughout the body  These procedures are usually performed using needles and narrow tubes called catheters  rather than by making large incisions into the body as in traditional surgery  Many conditions that once required open surgery can now be treated non surgically by interventional radiologists  By minimizing the physical trauma to the patient  non surgical interventions can minimize pain  reduce infection rates and recovery time  and shorten hospital stays IschemiaIschemia or ischaemia is a restriction in blood supply to tissues  causing a shortage of oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism  to keep tissue alive   Ischemia is generally caused by problems with blood vessels  with resultant damage to or dysfunction of tissue  It also means local anemia in a given part of a body sometimes resulting from congestion  such as vasoconstriction  thrombosis or embolism   Ischemia comprises not only insufficiency of oxygen  but also reduced availability of nutrients and inadequate removal of metabolic wastes  Ischemia can be partial  poor perfusion  that is  malperfusion  or total KaryolysisKaryolysis  from Greek        karyon   kernel  seed or nucleus   and       lysis from       lyein   to separate   is the complete dissolution of the chromatin of a dying cell due to the enzymatic degradation by endonucleases  The whole cell will eventually stain uniformly with eosin after karyolysis  It is usually associated with karyorrhexis and occurs mainly as a result of necrosis  while in apoptosis after karyorrhexis the nucleus usually dissolves into apoptotic bodies KaryorrhexisKaryorrhexis  from Greek        karyon   kernel  seed or nucleus   and       rhexis   bursting   is the destructive fragmentation of the nucleus of a dying cell whereby its chromatin is distributed irregularly throughout the cytoplasm  It is usually preceded by pyknosis and can occur as a result of either programmed cell death  apoptosis   senescence  or necrosis  In apoptosis  the cleavage of DNA is done by Ca   and Mg    dependent endonucleases LipochromeLipochrome is a form of pigment associated with green  amber  and gold tones in human eyes and the eyes of other mammals  The term carotenoid is sometimes considered a synonym  but that term usually refers to specific molecules  while lipochrome refers to accumulations of varied molecules LipofuscinLipofuscin is the name given to finely granular yellow brown pigment granules composed of lipid containing residues of lysosomal digestion  It is considered to be one of the aging or  wear and tear  pigments  found in the liver  kidney  heart muscle  retina  adrenals  nerve cells  and ganglion cells  It is specifically arranged around the nucleus  and is a type of lipochrome Liquefactive necrosisLiquefactive necrosis  or colliquative necrosis  is a type of necrosis which results in a transformation of the tissue into a liquid viscous mass  Often it is associated with focal bacterial or fungal infections  In liquefactive necrosis  the affected cell is completely digested by hydrolytic enzymes  resulting in a soft  circumscribed lesion consisting of pus and the fluid remains of necrotic tissue  Dead leukocytes will remain as a creamy yellow pus  After the removal of cell debris by white blood cells  a fluid filled space is left  It is generally associated with abscess formation and is commonly found in the central nervous system MD PhDThe Doctorate of Medicine and of Philosophy  MD PhD  is a dual doctoral degree for physician scientists  The degree is granted by medical schools often through the Medical Scientist Training Program or other non MSTP MD PhD programs  The National Institutes of Health currently provides    medical schools with Medical Scientist Training Program grants that support the training of students in MD PhD programs at these institutions through tuition and stipend allowances  These programs are often competitive  with some admitting as few as two students per academic year  The MCAT score and GPA of MD PhD matriculants are often higher than MD only matriculants Mass gathering medicineMass Gathering Medicine is a field of medicine that explores the health effects risks of mass gatherings and the strategies that contribute positively to effective health services delivery during these events  The reason for the development of the field of medicine gives the fact that mass gatherings generate a higher incidence of injury and illness  may be the subject to a catastrophic accident or attack with large numbers of injured or dead persons  Mass Gathering Medicine is viewed as a niche field of prehospital care in emergency medicine at the University of British Columbia  Among factors influencing on the demand for the health care at mass gatherings  are  the weather  duration of the event  if the crowd moves  containment of the event  fenced contained or not   availability of alcohol drugs  the density of the crowd et al   possibility for spreading of communicable diseases  Key purposes of Mass Gathering Medical Services at an event are  rapid access to the injured or ill patients  effective stabilizing and transporting injured or ill patients  on site care for minor injuries and illnesses  The Department of Global Alert and Response of the World Health Organization supports Member States hosting mass gatherings   Mass gathering medicine support requires planning in advance  Medical journal The Lancet held a conference on Mass Gathering Medicine in October      in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia   In       This Is Life with Lisa Ling filmed an episode featuring mass gathering medicine with event medical specialists Dr  Andrew Bazos and Connor Fitzpatrick of CrowdRx  Inc   The inaugural Mass Gathering Medicine Summit was held in New York City on April               The second annual Mass Gathering Medical Summit will be held in Las Vegas on February            Mass spectrometryMass spectrometry  MS  is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass to charge ratio  In simpler terms  a mass spectrum measures the masses within a sample  Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures  A mass spectrum is a plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass to charge ratio  These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample  the masses of particles and of molecules  and to elucidate the chemical structures of molecules  such as peptides and other chemical compounds  In a typical MS procedure  a sample  which may be solid  liquid  or gas  is ionized  for example by bombarding it with electrons  This may cause some of the sample s molecules to break into charged fragments  These ions are then separated according to their mass to charge ratio  typically by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field  ions of the same mass to charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection  The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles  such as an electron multiplier  Results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions as a function of the mass to charge ratio  The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern Master of MedicineMaster of Medicine  MMed  is a postgraduate academic degree awarded by medical schools to physicians following a period of instruction and examination  The degree is awarded by both surgical and medical subspecialties and usually includes a dissertation component involving original research  The degree may complement an existing fellowship in the chosen specialty or be the sole qualification necessary for registration as a specialist  The following universities in the following countries are known to award MMed degrees  in the following subjects  as of May        Master of SurgeryThe Master of Surgery  Latin  Magister Chirurgiae  is an advanced qualification in surgery  Depending upon the degree  it may be abbreviated Ch M   M Ch   M Chir  or M S  At a typical medical school the program lasts between two and three years  The possession of a medical degree is a prerequisite  The Ch M  can be awarded on both clinical and academic competency or on academic competency  The regulations may ask for surgical experience and a thesis topic that is not purely medical Maternal fetal medicineMaternal fetal medicine  MFM   also known as perinatology  is a branch of medicine that focuses on managing health concerns of the mother and fetus prior to  during  and shortly after pregnancy  Maternal fetal medicine specialists are specialists within the field of obstetrics  They may perform prenatal tests  provide treatments  and perform surgeries  They act both as a consult during lower risk pregnancies  and as the primary obstetrician in especially high risk pregnancies  After birth  they may work closely with pediatricians or neonatologists  For the mother  perinatologists assist with pre existing health concerns  as well as complications caused by pregnancy Medical educationMedical education is education related to the practice of being a medical practitioner  either the initial training to become a physician  i e   medical school and internship   or additional training thereafter  e g   residency and fellowship   Medical education and training varies considerably across the world  Various teaching methodologies have been utilised in medical education  which is an active area of educational research Medical geneticsMedical genetics is the branch of medicine that involves the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders  Medical genetics differs from human genetics in that human genetics is a field of scientific research that may or may not apply to medicine  while medical genetics refers to the application of genetics to medical care  For example  research on the causes and inheritance of genetic disorders would be considered within both human genetics and medical genetics  while the diagnosis  management  and counselling people with genetic disorders would be considered part of medical genetics  In contrast  the study of typically non medical phenotypes such as the genetics of eye color would be considered part of human genetics  but not necessarily relevant to medical genetics  except in situations such as albinism   Genetic medicine is a newer term for medical genetics and incorporates areas such as gene therapy  personalized medicine  and the rapidly emerging new medical specialty  predictive medicine Medical laboratoryA medical laboratory or clinical laboratory is a laboratory where tests are usually done on clinical specimens in order to obtain information about the health of a patient as pertaining to the diagnosis  treatment  and prevention of disease  Clinical laboratories are thus focused on applied science mainly on a production like basis  as opposed to research laboratories that focus on basic science on an academic basis Clinical MicrobiologyClinical microbiology is a branch of medical science concerned with the prevention  diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases  In addition  this field of science studies various clinical applications of microbes for the improvement of health  There are four kinds of microorganisms that cause infectious disease  bacteria  fungi  parasites and viruses  and one type of infectious protein called prion  A medical microbiologist studies the characteristics of pathogens  their modes of transmission  mechanisms of infection and growth  Using this information  a treatment can be devised  Medical microbiologists often serve as consultants for physicians  providing identification of pathogens and suggesting treatment options  Other tasks may include the identification of potential health risks to the community or monitoring the evolution of potentially virulent or resistant strains of microbes  educating the community and assisting in the design of health practices  They may also assist in preventing or controlling epidemics and outbreaks of disease  Not all medical microbiologists study microbial pathology  some study common  non pathogenic species to determine whether their properties can be used to develop antibiotics or other treatment methods  Whilst epidemiology is the study of the patterns  causes  and effects of health and disease conditions in populations  medical microbiology primarily focuses on the presence and growth of microbial infections in individuals  their effects on the human body and the methods of treating those infections Residency  medicine Residency is a stage of graduate medical training  A resident or house officer is a physician  one who holds the degree of M D   D O   or MBBS  MBChB  or BMed  who practices medicine usually in a hospital or clinic under the direct or indirect supervision of an attending physician  Successful completion of a residency program is a requirement to obtaining an unrestricted license to practice medicine in many jurisdictions  Residency training may be followed by fellowship or  sub specialty  training  Whereas medical school teaches physicians a broad range of medical knowledge  basic clinical skills  and supervised experience practicing medicine in a variety of fields  medical residency gives in depth training within a specific branch of medicine  A physician may choose a residency in anesthesiology  ophthalmology  cardiothoracic surgery  dermatology  emergency medicine  family medicine  internal medicine  neurology  neurosurgery  obstetrics and gynecology  otolaryngology  pathology  pediatrics  plastic and reconstructive surgery  psychiatry  physical medicine and rehabilitation  radiology  radiation oncology  oral and maxillofacial surgery  general surgery  urology or other medical specialties Medical schoolA medical school is a tertiary educational institution or part of such an institution that teaches medicine  and awards a professional degree for physicians and surgeons  Such medical degrees include the Bachelor of Medicine  Bachelor of Surgery  MBBS  MBChB  BMBS   Doctor of Medicine  MD   or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine  DO   Many medical schools offer additional degrees  such as a Doctor of Philosophy  Master s degree  a physician assistant program  or other post secondary education  Medical schools can also employ medical researchers and operate hospitals  Around the world  criteria  structure  teaching methodology  and nature of medical programs offered at medical schools vary considerably  Medical schools are often highly competitive  using standardized entrance examinations  as well as grade point average and leadership roles  to narrow the selection criteria for candidates  In most countries  the study of medicine is completed as an undergraduate degree not requiring prerequisite undergraduate coursework  However  an increasing number of places are emerging for graduate entrants who have completed an undergraduate degree including some required courses  In the United States and Canada  almost all medical degrees are second entry degrees  and require several years of previous study at the university level  Medical degrees are awarded to medical students after the completion of their degree program  which typically lasts five or more years for the undergraduate model and four years for the graduate model  Many modern medical schools integrate clinical education with basic sciences from the beginning of the curriculum  e g    More traditional curricula are usually divided into preclinical and clinical blocks  In preclinical sciences  students study subjects such as biochemistry  genetics  pharmacology  pathology  anatomy  physiology and medical microbiology  among others  Subsequent clinical rotations usually include internal medicine  general surgery  pediatrics  psychiatry  and obstetrics and gynecology  among others  Although medical schools confer upon graduates a medical degree  a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority  Licensing may also require passing a test  undergoing a criminal background check  checking references  paying a fee  and undergoing several years of postgraduate training  Medical schools are regulated by each country and appear in the World Directory of Medical Schools which was formed by the merger of the AVICENNA Directory for medicine and the FAIMER International Medical Education Directory Specialty  medicine A specialty  or speciality  in medicine is a branch of medical practice  After completing medical school  physicians or surgeons usually further their medical education in a specific specialty of medicine by completing a multiple year residency to become a medical specialist   Medical technologistA Medical Technologist  usually Medical laboratory scientist  Clinical Laboratory Scientist  Medical Laboratory Technologist  is an allied health professional that analyzes and tests body fluids and tissues  This includes blood  urine  CSF  synovial fluid  all types of tissue samples  and almost any type of sample removed from a patient for testing  They are responsible for operating and maintaining complex analyzers that are used in a laboratory and ensuring the laboratory results of each patient are accurate and timely  A medical technologist typically holds a bachelor s degree and has been through an internship  The internship can either be a portion of the degree program or be done after the laboratorian has already completed their degree  In some countries  medical technologists may be called biomedical scientists  medical laboratory scientists  clinical laboratory scientists or medical laboratory technologists MedicineMedicine  British English   m ds n   American English   m d s n   is the science and practice of the diagnosis  treatment  and prevention of disease  The word  medicine  is derived from Latin medicus  meaning  a physician   Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness  Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences  biomedical research  genetics  and medical technology to diagnose  treat  and prevent injury and disease  typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery  but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy  external splints and traction  medical devices  biologics  and ionizing radiation  amongst others  Medicine has existed for thousands of years  during most of which it was an art  an area of skill and knowledge  frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture  For example  a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing  or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism  In recent centuries  since the advent of modern science  most medicine has become a combination of art and science  both basic and applied  under the umbrella of medical science   While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice  the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science  Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine  They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine  For example  evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is  variable and inconsistent  for any condition  but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner  In contrast  treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery MelaninMelanin   m l n n   Greek          melas   black  dark   is a broad term for a group of natural pigments found in most organisms  Melanin is produced by the oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine  followed by polymerization  The pigment is produced in a specialized group of cells known as melanocytes  There are three basic types of melanin  eumelanin  pheomelanin  and neuromelanin  The most common is eumelanin  of which there are two types brown eumelanin and black eumelanin  Pheomelanin is a cysteine containing red polymer of benzothiazine units largely responsible for red hair  among other pigmentation  Neuromelanin is found in the brain  though its function remains obscure  In the skin  melanogenesis occurs after exposure to UV radiation  causing the skin to visibly tan  Melanin is an effective absorber of light  the pigment is able to dissipate over       of absorbed UV radiation  Because of this property  melanin is thought to protect skin cells from UVB radiation damage  reducing the risk of cancer  Furthermore  though exposure to UV radiation is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma  a cancer of the melanocytes  studies have shown a lower incidence for skin cancer in individuals with more concentrated melanin  i e  darker skin tone  Nonetheless  the relationship between skin pigmentation and photoprotection is still being clarified MetaplasiaMetaplasia  Greek   change in form   is the reversible replacement of one differentiated cell type with another mature differentiated cell type  The change from one type of cell to another may be part of a normal maturation process  or caused by some sort of abnormal stimulus  In simplistic terms  it is as if the original cells are not robust enough to withstand their environment  so they transform into another cell type better suited to their environment  If the stimulus causing metaplasia is removed or ceases  tissues return to their normal pattern of differentiation  Metaplasia is not synonymous with dysplasia  and is not considered to be an actual cancer  It is also contrasted with heteroplasia  which is the spontaneous abnormal growth of cytologic and histologic elements  Today  metaplastic changes are usually considered to be an early phase of carcinogenesis  specifically for those with a history of cancers or who are known to be susceptible to carcinogenic changes  Metaplastic change is often viewed as a premalignant condition that requires immediate intervention  either surgical or medical  because metaplasia is associated with cancer Microbiological cultureA microbiological culture  or microbial culture  is a method of multiplying microbial organisms by letting them reproduce in predetermined culture media under controlled laboratory conditions  Microbial cultures are used to determine the type of organism  its abundance in the sample being tested  or both  It is one of the primary diagnostic methods of microbiology and used as a tool to determine the cause of infectious disease by letting the agent multiply in a predetermined medium  For example  a throat culture is taken by scraping the lining of tissue in the back of the throat and blotting the sample into a medium to be able to screen for harmful microorganisms  such as Streptococcus pyogenes  the causative agent of strep throat  Furthermore  the term culture is more generally used informally to refer to  selectively growing  a specific kind of microorganism in the lab  Microbial cultures are foundational and basic diagnostic methods used extensively as a research tool in molecular biology  It is often essential to isolate a pure culture of microorganisms  A pure  or axenic  culture is a population of cells or multicellular organisms growing in the absence of other species or types  A pure culture may originate from a single cell or single organism  in which case the cells are genetic clones of one another  For the purpose of gelling the microbial culture  the medium of agarose gel  agar  is used  Agar is a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed  A cheap substitute for agar is guar gum  which can be used for the isolation and maintenance of thermophiles Molecular diagnosticsMolecular diagnostics is a collection of techniques used to analyse biological markers in the genome and proteome the individual s genetic code and how their cells express their genes as proteins by applying molecular biology to medical testing  The technique is used to diagnose and monitor disease  detect risk  and decide which therapies will work best for individual patients  By analysing the specifics of the patient and their disease  molecular diagnostics offers the prospect of personalised medicine  These tests are useful in a range of medical specialisms  including infectious disease  oncology  human leucocyte antigen typing  which investigates and predicts immune function   coagulation  and pharmacogenomics the genetic prediction of which drugs will work best  They overlap with clinical chemistry  medical tests on bodily fluids  Molecular oncologyMolecular oncology is an interdisciplinary medical speciality at the interface of medicinal chemistry and oncology that refers to the investigation of the chemistry of cancer and tumors at the molecular scale  Also the development and application of molecularly targeted therapies Journal of Clinical PathologyThe Journal of Clinical Pathology is a peer reviewed medical journal covering all aspects of pathology  published by the BMJ Group on behalf of the Association of Clinical Pathologists  Diagnostic and research areas covered include histopathology  virology  haematology  microbiology  cytopathology  chemical pathology  molecular pathology  forensic pathology  dermatopathology  neuropathology  and immunopathology  Each issue contains reviews  original articles  short reports  case reports  correspondence  and book reviews  In      the Journal of Clinical Pathology incorporated Molecular Pathology  which was published from           Timeline of myocardial infarction pathologyThis table gives an overview of the pathology seen in myocardial infarction by time after obstruction  For the first     minutes no change at all can be seen by gross examination or by light microscopy in histopathology  However  in electron microscopy relaxed myofibrils  as well as glycogen loss and mitochondrial swelling can be seen  Once scarring is completed  there is yet no common method of telling the actual age of the infarct  since e g  a scar that is four months old looks identical to a scar that is ten years old   It is often possible  however  to highlight the area of necrosis that first becomes apparent after   to   hours by immersion of tissue slices in a solution of triphenyltetrazolium chloride  This dye imparts a brick red color to intact  noninfarcted myocardium where the dehydrogenase activity is preserved  Because dehydrogenases are depleted in the area of ischemic necrosis  i e   they leak out through the damaged cell membranes   an infarcted area is revealed as an unstained pale zone  Instead of a triphenyltetrazolium chloride dye  a LDH  lactate dehydrogenase  dye can also be used to visualize an area of necrosis NanomedicineNanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology  Nanomedicine ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials and biological devices  to nanoelectronic biosensors  and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology such as biological machines  Current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials  materials whose structure is on the scale of nanometers  i e  billionths of a meter   Functionalities can be added to nanomaterials by interfacing them with biological molecules or structures  The size of nanomaterials is similar to that of most biological molecules and structures  therefore  nanomaterials can be useful for both in vivo and in vitro biomedical research and applications  Thus far  the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devices  contrast agents  analytical tools  physical therapy applications  and drug delivery vehicles  Nanomedicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically useful devices in the near future  The National Nanotechnology Initiative expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems  new therapies  and in vivo imaging  Nanomedicine research is receiving funding from the US National Institutes of Health  including the funding in      of a five year plan to set up four nanomedicine centers  Nanomedicine sales reached     billion in       with a minimum of      billion in nanotechnology R D being invested every year  Global funding for emerging nanotechnology increased by     per year in recent years  with product sales exceeding    trillion in       As the nanomedicine industry continues to grow  it is expected to have a significant impact on the economy NecrosisNecrosis  from the Greek           death  the stage of dying  the act of killing  from         dead   is a form of cell injury which results in the premature death of cells in living tissue by autolysis  Necrosis is caused by factors external to the cell or tissue  such as infection  toxins  or trauma which result in the unregulated digestion of cell components  In contrast  apoptosis is a naturally occurring programmed and targeted cause of cellular death  While apoptosis often provides beneficial effects to the organism  necrosis is almost always detrimental and can be fatal  Cellular death due to necrosis does not follow the apoptotic signal transduction pathway  but rather various receptors are activated  and result in the loss of cell membrane integrity and an uncontrolled release of products of cell death into the extracellular space  This initiates in the surrounding tissue an inflammatory response which attracts leukocytes and nearby phagocytes which eliminate the dead cells by phagocytosis  However  microbial damaging substances released by leukocytes would create collateral damage to surrounding tissues  Too much collateral damage would inhibit the healing process  Thus  untreated necrosis results in a build up of decomposing dead tissue and cell debris at or near the site of the cell death  A classic example is gangrene  For this reason  it is often necessary to remove necrotic tissue surgically  a procedure known as debridement NeonatologyNeonatology is a subspecialty of pediatrics that consists of the medical care of newborn infants  especially the ill or premature newborn infant  It is a hospital based specialty  and is usually practiced in neonatal intensive care units  NICUs   The principal patients of neonatologists are newborn infants who are ill or requiring special medical care due to prematurity  low birth weight  intrauterine growth retardation  congenital malformations  birth defects   sepsis  pulmonary hypoplasia or birth asphyxias NeoplasmNeoplasm is an abnormal growth of tissue  and  when it also forms a mass  is commonly referred to as a tumor  This abnormal growth  neoplasia  usually but not always forms a mass  The World Health Organization  WHO  classifies neoplasms into four main groups  benign neoplasms  in situ neoplasms  malignant neoplasms  and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior  Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as cancers  Prior to the abnormal growth of tissue  as neoplasia  cells often undergo an abnormal pattern of growth  such as metaplasia or dysplasia  However  metaplasia or dysplasia does not always progress to neoplasia  The word is from Ancient Greek       neo  new  and        plasma  formation  creation  NephrologyNephrology  from Greek        nephros  kidney   combined with the suffix  logy   the study of   is a specialty of medicine and pediatrics that concerns itself with the study of normal kidney function  kidney problems  the treatment of kidney problems and renal replacement therapy  dialysis and kidney transplantation   Systemic conditions that affect the kidneys  such as diabetes and autoimmune disease  and systemic problems that occur as a result of kidney problems  such as renal osteodystrophy and hypertension  are also studied in nephrology  A physician who has undertaken additional training to become an expert in nephrology may call themselves a nephrologist or renal physician  The term  nephrology  was first used in about       Before then  the specialty was usually referred to as  kidney medicine  NeurologyNeurology  from Greek          neuron  and the suffix         logia  study of   is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the nervous system  Neurology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of conditions and disease involving the central and peripheral nervous system  and its subdivisions  the autonomic nervous system and the somatic nervous system   including their coverings  blood vessels  and all effector tissue  such as muscle  Neurological practice relies heavily on the field of neuroscience  which is the scientific study of the nervous system  A neurologist is a physician specializing in neurology and trained to investigate  or diagnose and treat neurological disorders  Neurologists may also be involved in clinical research  clinical trials  and basic or translational research  While neurology is a non surgical specialty  its corresponding surgical specialty is neurosurgery NeurosurgeryNeurosurgery  or neurological surgery  is the medical specialty concerned with the prevention  diagnosis  surgical treatment  and rehabilitation of disorders which affect any portion of the nervous system including the brain  spinal cord  peripheral nerves  and extra cranial cerebrovascular system Nuclear medicineNuclear medicine is a medical specialty involving the application of radioactive substances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease  Nuclear medicine  in a sense  is  radiology done inside out  or  endoradiology  because it records radiation emitting from within the body rather than radiation that is generated by external sources like X rays  In addition  nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy but the function and for such reason  it is called a physiological imaging modality  Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography or SPECT and Positron Emission Tomography or PET scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine ObstetricsObstetrics is the field of study concentrated on pregnancy  childbirth  and the postpartum period  As a medical specialty  obstetrics is combined with gynaecology under the discipline known as obstetrics and gynaecology  OB GYN    Obstetrics and gynaecologyObstetrics and Gynecology  commonly known as OB GYN  OBG  O G or Obs   Gynae  is the medical specialty that deals with obstetrics and gynecology  The postgraduate training program for both aspects is unified  This combined training prepares the practicing OB GYN to be adept at the care of female reproductive organs  health and at the management of pregnancy Occupational medicineOccupational medicine  especially until      called industrial medicine  is the branch of medicine which deals with the maintenance of health in the workplace  including the prevention and treatment of diseases and injuries  and also promotes productivity and social adjustment  It is thus the branch of clinical medicine most active in the field of occupational health and safety  OM specialists work to ensure that the highest standards of occupational health and safety can be achieved and maintained  While OM may involve a wide number of disciplines  it centers on preventive medicine and the management of illness  injury  and disability related to the workplace  Occupational physicians must have a wide knowledge of clinical medicine and be competent in a number of important areas  They often advise international bodies  governmental and state agencies  organizations and trade unions  There are contextual links to physical medicine and rehabilitation and to insurance medicine   OncologyOncology is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention  diagnosis and treatment of cancer  A medical professional who practices oncology is an oncologist  The name s etymological origin is the Greek word         nkos   meaning  tumor    volume  or  mass   The three components which have improved survival in cancer are  Prevention   This is by reduction of risk factors like tobacco and alcohol consumption Early diagnosis   Screening of common cancers and comprehensive diagnosis and staging Treatment   Multimodality management by discussion in tumor board and treatment in a comprehensive cancer centre Cancers are often managed through discussion on multi disciplinary cancer conferences where medical oncologist  surgical oncologist  radiation oncologist  pathologist  radiologist and organ specific oncologists meet to find the best possible management for an individual patient considering the physical  social  psychological  emotional and financial status of the patients  It is very important for oncologists to keep updated of the latest advancements in oncology  as changes in management of cancer are quite common  All eligible patients in whom cancer progresses and for whom no standard of care treatment options are available should be enrolled in a clinical trial OphthalmologyOphthalmology     f   l m  l d i  or    p   l m l d i   is the branch of medicine that deals with the anatomy  physiology and diseases of the eyeball  An ophthalmologist is a specialist in medical and surgical eye problems  Since ophthalmologists perform operations on eyes  they are both surgical and medical specialists  A multitude of diseases and conditions can be diagnosed from the eye Oral and maxillofacial pathologyOral and maxillofacial pathology  also termed oral pathology  stomatognathic disease  dental disease  or mouth disease  refers to the diseases of the mouth   oral cavity  or  stoma    jaws   maxillae  or  gnath   and related structures such as salivary glands  temporomandibular joints  facial muscles and perioral skin  the skin around the mouth   The mouth is an important organ with many different functions  It is also prone to a variety of medical and dental disorders  The specialty oral and maxillofacial pathology is concerned with diagnosis and study of the causes and effects of diseases affecting the oral and maxillofacial region  It is sometimes considered to be a specialty of dentistry and pathology  Sometimes the term head and neck pathology is used instead  but this might imply that the pathologist deals with otorhinolaryngologic disorders  i e  ear  nose and throat  in addition to maxillofacial disorders  In this role there is some overlap between the expertise of head and neck pathologists and that of endocrine pathologists Oral and maxillofacial surgeryOral   Maxillofacial surgery  OMS or OMFS  specializes in treating many diseases  injuries and defects in the head  neck  face  jaws and the hard and soft tissues of the Oral  mouth  and Maxillofacial  jaws and face  region  It is an internationally recognized surgical specialty  In some countries around the world  including the United States  India  Canada  Australia  Sweden and Israel  it is a recognized specialty of dentistry  in others  such as the UK and most of Europe  it is recognized as both a specialty of medicine and dentistry and a dual degree in medicine and dentistry is compulsory Oral medicineOral medicine  sometimes termed dental medicine  oral and maxillofacial medicine or stomatology  is a specialty focused on the mouth and nearby structures  It lies at the interface between medicine and dentistry  The specialty is defined within Europe under Directive         EC Organ transplantationOrgan transplantation is a medical procedure in which an organ is removed from one body and placed in the body of a recipient  to replace a damaged or missing organ  The donor and recipient may be at the same location  or organs may be transported from a donor site to another location  Organs and or tissues that are transplanted within the same person s body are called autografts  Transplants that are recently performed between two subjects of the same species are called allografts  Allografts can either be from a living or cadaveric source  Organs that have been successfully transplanted include the heart  kidneys  liver  lungs  pancreas  intestine  and thymus  Some organs  like the brain  cannot be transplanted  Tissues include bones  tendons  both referred to as musculoskeletal grafts   corneae  skin  heart valves  nerves and veins  Worldwide  the kidneys are the most commonly transplanted organs  followed by the liver and then the heart  Corneae and musculoskeletal grafts are the most commonly transplanted tissues  these outnumber organ transplants by more than tenfold  Organ donors may be living  brain dead  or dead via circulatory death  Tissue may be recovered from donors who die of circulatory death  as well as of brain death   up to    hours past the cessation of heartbeat  Unlike organs  most tissues  with the exception of corneas  can be preserved and stored for up to five years  meaning they can be  banked   Transplantation raises a number of bioethical issues  including the definition of death  when and how consent should be given for an organ to be transplanted  and payment for organs for transplantation  Other ethical issues include transplantation tourism and more broadly the socio economic context in which organ procurement or transplantation may occur  A particular problem is organ trafficking  Transplantation medicine is one of the most challenging and complex areas of modern medicine  Some of the key areas for medical management are the problems of transplant rejection  during which the body has an immune response to the transplanted organ  possibly leading to transplant failure and the need to immediately remove the organ from the recipient  When possible  transplant rejection can be reduced through serotyping to determine the most appropriate donor recipient match and through the use of immunosuppressant drugs Orthopedic surgeryOrthopedic surgery or orthopedics  alternatively spelled orthopaedic surgery and orthopaedics  is the branch of surgery concerned with conditions involving the musculoskeletal system  Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat musculoskeletal trauma  spine diseases  sports injuries  degenerative diseases  infections  tumors  and congenital disorders OtorhinolaryngologyOtorhinolaryngology  o to  ra no  l r n   l d i   also called otolaryngology head and neck surgery  is a surgical subspecialty within medicine that deals with conditions of the ear  nose  and throat  ENT  and related structures of the head and neck  Doctors who specialize in this area are called otorhinolaryngologists  otolaryngologists  ENT doctors  ENT surgeons  or head and neck surgeons  Patients seek treatment from an otorhinolaryngologist for diseases of the ear  nose  throat  base of the skull  and for the surgical management of cancers and benign tumors of the head and neck Outline of medicineThe following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to medicine  Medicine   science of healing  It encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness Pain managementPain management  pain medicine  pain control or algiatry  is a branch of medicine employing an interdisciplinary approach for easing the suffering and improving the quality of life of those living with chronic pain The typical pain management team includes medical practitioners  pharmacists  clinical psychologists  physiotherapists  occupational therapists  physician assistants  nurse practitioners  and clinical nurse specialists  The team may also include other mental health specialists and massage therapists  Pain sometimes resolves promptly once the underlying trauma or pathology has healed  and is treated by one practitioner  with drugs such as analgesics and  occasionally  anxiolytics  Effective management of chronic  long term  pain  however  frequently requires the coordinated efforts of the management team  Medicine treats injury and pathology to support and speed healing  and treats distressing symptoms such as pain to relieve suffering during treatment and healing  When a painful injury or pathology is resistant to treatment and persists  when pain persists after the injury or pathology has healed  and when medical science cannot identify the cause of pain  the task of medicine is to relieve suffering  Treatment approaches to chronic pain include pharmacological measures  such as analgesics  antidepressants and anticonvulsants  interventional procedures  physical therapy  physical exercise  application of ice and or heat  and psychological measures  such as biofeedback and cognitive behavioral therapy Palliative carePalliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life limiting illnesses  It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms  pain  physical stress  and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis  The goal of such therapy is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family  Evidence as of      supports improvement in quality of life  Palliative care is provided by a team of physicians  nurses  physiotherapists  occupational therapists and other health professionals who work together with the primary care physician and referred specialists  or  for patients who don t have those  hospital or hospice staff  to provide an extra layer of support  It is appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness and can be provided as the main goal of care or along with curative treatment  Therefore  although it is an important part of end of life care  it is not limited to that stage  Palliative care can be provided across multiple settings including in hospitals  in the patient s home  as part of community palliative care programs  and in skilled nursing facilities  Interdisciplinary palliative care teams work with patients and their families to clarify goals of care and provide symptom management  psycho social  and spiritual support  Physicians sometimes use the term palliative care in a sense meaning palliative therapies without curative intent  when no cure can be expected  as often happens in late stage cancers   For example  tumor debulking can continue to reduce pain from mass effect even when it is no longer curative  A clearer usage is palliative  noncurative therapy when that is what is meant  because palliative care can be used along with curative or aggressive therapies  Medications and treatments are said to have a palliative effect if they relieve symptoms without having a curative effect on the underlying disease or cause  This can include treating nausea related to chemotherapy or something as simple as morphine to treat the pain of broken leg or ibuprofen to treat aching related to an influenza  flu  infection  Although the concept of palliative care is not new  most physicians have traditionally concentrated on trying to cure people PathogenesisThe pathogenesis of a disease is the biological mechanism  or mechanisms  that leads to the diseased state  The term can also describe the origin and development of the disease  and whether it is acute  chronic  or recurrent  The word comes from the Greek pathos   disease   and genesis   creation   PathologyPathology  from the Greek roots of pathos          meaning  experience  or  suffering   and  logia            study of   is a significant component of the causal study of disease and a major field in modern medicine and diagnosis  The term pathology itself may be used broadly to refer to the study of disease in general  incorporating a wide range of bioscience research fields and medical practices  including plant pathology and veterinary pathology   or more narrowly to describe work within the contemporary medical field of  general pathology   which includes a number of distinct but inter related medical specialties that diagnose disease mostly through analysis of tissue  cell  and body fluid samples  Used as a count noun   a pathology   plural   pathologies   can also refer to the predicted or actual progression of particular diseases  as in the statement  the many different forms of cancer have diverse pathologies    and the affix path is sometimes used to indicate a state of disease in cases of both physical ailment  as in cardiomyopathy  and psychological conditions  such as psychopathy   Similarly  a pathological condition is one caused by disease  rather than occurring physiologically  A physician practicing pathology is called a pathologist  As a field of general inquiry and research  pathology addresses four components of disease  cause etiology  mechanisms of development  pathogenesis   structural alterations of cells  morphologic changes   and the consequences of changes  clinical manifestations   In common medical practice  general pathology is mostly concerned with analyzing known clinical abnormalities that are markers or precursors for both infectious and non infectious disease and is conducted by experts in one of two major specialties  anatomical pathology and clinical pathology  Further divisions in specialty exist on the basis of the involved sample types  comparing  for example  cytopathology  hematopathology  and histopathology   organs  as in renal pathology   and physiological systems  oral pathology   as well as on the basis of the focus of the examination  as with forensic pathology   The sense of the word pathology as a synonym of disease or pathosis is very common in health care  The persistence of this usage despite attempted proscription is discussed elsewhere PathologyPathology  from the Greek roots of pathos          meaning  experience  or

Pediatric surgery arose in the middle of the      century as the surgical care of birth defects required novel techniques and methods and became more commonly based at children s hospitals  One of the sites of this innovation was Children s Hospital of Philadelphia  Beginning in the     s under the surgical leadership of C  Everett Koop  newer techniques for endotracheal anesthesia of infants allowed surgical repair of previously untreatable birth defects  By the late     s  the infant death rate from several major congenital malformation syndromes had been reduced to near zero  Subspecialties of pediatric surgery itself include  neonatal surgery and fetal surgery  Other areas of surgery also have pediatric specialties of their own that require further training during the residencies and in a fellowship  pediatric cardiothoracic  surgery on the child s heart and or lungs  including heart and or lung transplantation   pediatric nephrological surgery  surgery on the child s kidneys and ureters  including renal  or kidney  transplantation   pediatric neurosurgery  surgery on the child s brain  central nervous system  spinal cord  and peripheral nerves   pediatric urological surgery  surgery on the child s urinary bladder and other structures below the kidney necessary for ejaculation   pediatric emergency surgery  surgery involving fetuses or embryos  overlapping with obstetric gynecological surgery  neonatology  and maternal fetal medicine   surgery involving adolescents or young adults  pediatric hepatological  liver  and gastrointestinal  stomach and intestines  surgery  including liver and intestinal transplantation in children   pediatric orthopedic surgery  muscle and bone surgery in children   pediatric plastic and reconstructive surgery  such as for burns  or for congenital defects like cleft palate not involving the major organs   and pediatric oncological  childhood cancer  surgery  Common pediatric diseases that may require pediatric surgery include  congenital malformations  lymphangioma  cleft lip and palate  esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula  hypertrophic pyloric stenosis  intestinal atresia  necrotizing enterocolitis  meconium plugs  Hirschsprung s disease  imperforate anus  undescended testes abdominal wall defects  omphalocele  gastroschisis  hernias chest wall deformities  pectus

journal published by the American Academy of Pediatrics  In the inaugural January      issue  the journal s first editor in chief  Hugh McCulloch  articulated the journal s vision   The content of the journal is    intended to encompass the needs of the whole child in his physiologic  mental  emotional  and social structure  The single word  Pediatrics  has been chosen to indicate this catholic intent   Pediatrics has been continuously published by the American Academy of Pediatrics since January       According to the Journal Citation Reports  the journal has a      impact factor of        ranking it fourth out of     journals in the category  Pediatrics  Personalized medicinePersonalised medicine is a medical procedure that separates patients into different groups with medical decisions  practices  interventions and or products being tailored to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease  The terms personalized medicine  precision medicine  stratified medicine and P  medicine are used interchangeably to describe this concept though some authors and organisations use these expressions separately to indicate particular nuances  While the tailoring of treatment to patients dates back at least to the time of Hippocrates  the term has risen in usage in recent years given the growth of new diagnostic and informatics approaches that provide understanding of the molecular basis of disease  particularly genomics  This provides a clear evidence base on which to stratify  group  related patients Physical medicine and rehabilitationPhysical medicine and rehabilitation  PM R   also known as physiatry  f  za   tri  or rehabilitation medicine  or physical and rehabilitation medicine  PRM  outside of the United States  is a branch of medicine that aims to enhance and restore functional ability and quality of life to those with physical impairments or disabilities  A physician having completed training in this field is referred to as a physiatrist  Physiatrists specialize in restoring optimal function to people with injuries to the muscles  bones  ligaments  or nervous system PhysicianA physician  medical practitioner  medical doctor or simply doctor is a professional who practises medicine  which is concerned with promoting  maintaining  or restoring health through the study  diagnosis  and treatment of disease  injury  and other physical and mental impairments  Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories  types of patients and methods of treatment known as specialities or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals  families  and communities known as general practice  Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines  such as anatomy and physiology  underlying diseases and their treatment the science of medicine and also a decent competence in its applied practice the art or craft of medicine  Both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world  Degrees and other qualifications vary widely  but there are some common elements  such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration  compassion  and benevolence for their patients PigmentA pigment is a material that changes the color of reflected or transmitted light as the result of wavelength selective absorption  This physical process differs from fluorescence  phosphorescence  and other forms of luminescence  in which a material emits light  Many materials selectively absorb certain wavelengths of light  Materials that humans have chosen and developed for use as pigments usually have special properties that make them ideal for coloring other materials  A pigment must have a high tinting strength relative to the materials it colors  It must be stable in solid form at ambient temperatures  For industrial applications  as well as in the arts  permanence and stability are desirable properties  Pigments that are not permanent are called fugitive  Fugitive pigments fade over time  or with exposure to light  while some eventually blacken  Pigments are used for coloring paint  ink  plastic  fabric  cosmetics  food  and other materials  Most pigments used in manufacturing and the visual arts are dry colorants  usually ground into a fine powder  This powder is added to a binder  or vehicle   a relatively neutral or colorless material that suspends the pigment and gives the paint its adhesion  A distinction is usually made between a pigment  which is insoluble in its vehicle  resulting in a suspension   and a dye  which either is itself a liquid or is soluble in its vehicle  resulting in a solution   A colorant can act as either a pigment or a dye depending on the vehicle involved  In some cases  a pigment can be manufactured from a dye by precipitating a soluble dye with a metallic salt  The resulting pigment is called a lake pigment  The term biological pigment is used for all colored substances independent of their solubility  In       around     million tons of inorganic  organic and special pigments were marketed worldwide  Asia has the highest rate on a quantity basis followed by Europe and North America  By       revenues will have risen to approx  US      billion  The global demand on pigments was roughly US      billion in       around        up from the previous year  It is predicted to increase in a stable growth rate in the coming years  The worldwide sales are said to increase up to US      billion in       and reach US      billion in      Plastic surgeryPlastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration  reconstruction  or alteration of the human body  It includes cosmetic or aesthetic surgery  reconstructive surgery  craniofacial surgery  hand surgery  microsurgery  and the treatment of burns PodiatryPodiatry   po  da  tri   or podiatric medicine   po di  tr k  or  po  da  tr k   is a branch of medicine devoted to the study  diagnosis  and medical and surgical treatment of disorders of the foot  ankle and lower extremity  The term podiatry came into use in the early   th century in the United States and is now used worldwide  including countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia  Podiatry is practiced as a specialty in many countries  while in many English speaking countries  the older title of chiropodist may be used by some clinicians  not to be confused with chiropractic  which is unrelated   In Australia  graduates of recognised academic programs can register through the Podiatry Board of Australia as a  podiatrist   and those with additional recognised training may also receive endorsement to prescribe or administer restricted medications  and or seek specialist registration as a  podiatric surgeon   In many non English speaking countries of Europe  the title used may be podologist or pod logo  The level and scope of the practice of podiatry vary among countries  According to the American Association of Colleges of Podiatric Medicine  a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine  DPM  is a medical specialist who diagnoses and treats conditions affecting the foot  ankle  and structures of the leg  The US podiatric medical school curriculum includes lower extremity anatomy  general human anatomy  physiology  general medicine  physical assessment  biochemistry  neurobiology  pathophysiology  genetics and embryology  microbiology  histology  pharmacology  women s health  physical rehabilitation  sports medicine  research  ethics and jurisprudence  biomechanics  general principles of orthopedic surgery  and foot and ankle surgery  US trained podiatrists rotate through major areas of medicine during residency  including emergency medicine  orthopedic surgery  general surgery  anesthesia  radiology  pathology  infectious disease  endocrinology  sports medicine  physical therapy  biomechanics  geriatrics  internal medicine  critical care  cardiology  vascular surgery  psychiatric and behavioral health  neurology  pediatrics  dermatology  pain management  wound care and primary care Preventive healthcarePreventive healthcare  alternately preventive medicine or prophylaxis  consists of measures taken for disease prevention  as opposed to disease treatment  Just as health encompasses a variety of physical and mental states  so do disease and disability  which are affected by environmental factors  genetic predisposition  disease agents  and lifestyle choices  Health  disease  and disability are dynamic processes which begin before individuals realize they are affected  Disease prevention relies on anticipatory actions that can be categorized as primal  primary  secondary  and tertiary prevention  Each year  millions of people die of preventable deaths  A      study showed that about half of all deaths in the United States in      were due to preventable behaviors and exposures  Leading causes included cardiovascular disease  chronic respiratory disease  unintentional injuries  diabetes  and certain infectious diseases  This same study estimates that         people die each year in the United States due to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle  According to estimates made by the World Health Organization  WHO   about    million people died worldwide in       two thirds of this group from non communicable diseases  including cancer  diabetes  and chronic cardiovascular and lung diseases  This is an increase from the year       during which     of deaths were attributed to these diseases  Preventive healthcare is especially important given the worldwide rise in prevalence of chronic diseases and deaths from these diseases  There are many methods for prevention of disease  It is recommended that adults and children aim to visit their doctor for regular check ups  even if they feel healthy  to perform disease screening  identify risk factors for disease  discuss tips for a healthy and balanced lifestyle  stay up to date with immunizations and boosters  and maintain a good relationship with a healthcare provider  Some common disease screenings include checking for hypertension  high blood pressure   hyperglycemia  high blood sugar  a risk factor for diabetes mellitus   hypercholesterolemia  high blood cholesterol   screening for colon cancer  depression  HIV and other common types of sexually transmitted disease such as chlamydia  syphilis  and gonorrhea  mammography  to screen for breast cancer   colorectal cancer screening  a pap test  to check for cervical cancer   and screening for osteoporosis  Genetic testing can also be performed to screen for mutations that cause genetic disorders or predisposition to certain diseases such as breast or ovarian cancer  However  these measures are not affordable for every individual and the cost effectiveness of preventive healthcare is still a topic of debate Programmed cell deathProgrammed cell death  or PCD  is the death of a cell in any form  mediated by an intracellular program  PCD is carried out in a biological process  which usually confers advantage during an organism s life cycle  For example  the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose  the result is that the digits are separate  PCD serves fundamental functions during both plant and animal tissue development  Apoptosis and autophagy are both forms of programmed cell death  but necrosis was long seen as a non physiological process that occurs as a result of infection or injury  Necrosis is the death of a cell caused by external factors such as trauma or infection and occurs in several different forms  Recently a form of programmed necrosis  called necroptosis  has been recognized as an alternate form of programmed cell death  It is hypothesized that necroptosis can serve as a cell death backup to apoptosis when the apoptosis signaling is blocked by endogenous or exogenous factors such as viruses or mutations  Most recently  other types of regulated necrosis have been discovered as well  which share several signaling events with necroptosis and apoptosis ProteomicsProteomics is the large scale study of proteins  Proteins are vital parts of living organisms  with many functions  The term proteomics was coined in      in analogy with genomics  the study of the genome  The word proteome is a portmanteau of protein and genome  and was coined by Marc Wilkins in      while a PhD student at Macquarie University  Macquarie University also founded the first dedicated proteomics laboratory in       the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility   APAF   The proteome is the entire set of proteins  produced or modified by an organism or system  This varies with time and distinct requirements  or stresses  that a cell or organism undergoes  Proteomics is an interdisciplinary domain that has benefited greatly from the genetic information of the Human Genome Project  it is also emerging scientific research and exploration of proteomes from the overall level of intracellular protein composition  structure  and its own unique activity patterns  It is an important component of functional genomics  While proteomics generally refers to the large scale experimental analysis of proteins  it is often specifically used for protein purification and mass spectrometry PsychiatryPsychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the diagnosis  prevention  study  and treatment of mental disorders  These include various abnormalities related to mood  behaviour  cognition  and perceptions  Initial psychiatric assessment of a person typically begins with a case history and mental status examination  Physical examinations and psychological tests may be conducted  On occasion  neuroimaging or other neurophysiological techniques are used  Mental disorders are often diagnosed in accordance with criteria listed in diagnostic manuals such as the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  DSM   published by the American Psychiatric Association  APA   and the International Classification of Diseases  ICD   edited and used by the World Health Organization  WHO   The fifth edition of the DSM  DSM    was published in       and its development was expected to be of significant interest to many medical fields  The combined treatment of psychiatric medication and psychotherapy has become the most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current practice  but contemporary practice also includes a wide variety of other modalities  e g   assertive community treatment  community reinforcement  and supported employment  Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis  depending on the severity of functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question  Research and treatment within psychiatry as a whole are conducted on an interdisciplinary basis  e g   with epidemiologists  mental health counselors  nurses  psychologists  public health specialists  radiologists  and or social workers Public healthPublic health refers to  the science and art of preventing disease  prolonging life and promoting human health through organized efforts and informed choices of society  organizations  public and private  communities and individuals   It is concerned with threats to health based on population health analysis  The population in question can be as small as a handful of people  or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents  for instance  in the case of a pandemic   The dimensions of health can encompass  a state of complete physical  mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity   as defined by the United Nations  World Health Organization  Public health incorporates the interdisciplinary approaches of epidemiology  biostatistics and health services  Environmental health  community health  behavioral health  health economics  public policy  mental health and occupational safety and health are other important subfields  The focus of public health intervention is to improve health and quality of life through prevention and treatment of disease and other physical and mental health conditions  This is done through surveillance of cases and health indicators  and through promotion of healthy behaviors  Examples of common public health measures include promotion of hand washing  breastfeeding  delivery of vaccinations  suicide prevention and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  Modern public health practice requires multidisciplinary teams of public health workers and professionals including the following  physicians specializing in public health  community medicine  or infectious disease  psychologists  epidemiologists  biostatisticians  medical assistants or Assistant Medical Officers  public health nurses  midwives  medical microbiologists  environmental health officers or public health inspectors  pharmacists  dentists  dietitians and nutritionists  veterinarians  public health engineers  public health lawyers  sociologists  community development workers  communications experts  bioethicists  and others  There is a great disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed nations and developing nations  In the developing world  public health infrastructures are still forming PulmonologyPulmonology is a medical speciality that deals with diseases involving the respiratory tract  The term is derived from the Latin word pulm   pulm nis   lung   and the Greek suffix          logia   study of    Pulmonology is synonymous with pneumology  from Greek           lung   and          respirology and respiratory medicine  Pulmonology is known as chest medicine and respiratory medicine in some countries and areas  Pulmonology is considered a branch of internal medicine  and is related to intensive care medicine  Pulmonology often involves managing patients who need life support and mechanical ventilation  Pulmonologists are specially trained in diseases and conditions of the chest  particularly pneumonia  asthma  tuberculosis  emphysema  and complicated chest infections PyknosisPyknosis  or karyopyknosis  is the irreversible condensation of chromatin in the nucleus of a cell undergoing necrosis or apoptosis  It is followed by karyorrhexis  or fragmentation of the nucleus  Pyknosis  from Greek pyknono meaning  to thicken up  to close or to condense   is also observed in the maturation of erythrocytes  a red blood cell  and the neutrophil  a type of white blood cell   The maturing metarubricyte  a stage in RBC maturation  will condense its nucleus before expelling it to become a reticulocyte  The maturing neutrophil will condense its nucleus into several connected lobes that stay in the cell until the end of its cell life  Pyknotic nuclei are often found in the zona reticularis of the adrenal gland  They are also found in the keratinocytes of the outermost layer in parakeratinised epithelium Radiation therapyRadiation therapy or radiotherapy  often abbreviated RT  RTx  or XRT  is therapy using ionizing radiation  generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells and normally delivered by a linear accelerator  Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body  It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy  to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor  for example  early stages of breast cancer   Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy  and has been used before  during  and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers  The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncology  Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth  Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue leading to cellular death  To spare normal tissues  such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor   shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor  providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding  healthy tissue  Besides the tumour itself  the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor  or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread  It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set up and internal tumor motion  These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement  for example  respiration and bladder filling  and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position  Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation  and is distinct from radiology  the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis  Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure   curative   or for adjuvant therapy  It may also be used as palliative treatment  where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief  or as therapeutic treatment  where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative   It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery  chemotherapy  hormone therapy  immunotherapy or some mixture of the four  Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way  The precise treatment intent  curative  adjuvant  neoadjuvant therapeutic  or palliative  will depend on the tumor type  location  and stage  as well as the general health of the patient  Total body irradiation  TBI  is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant  Brachytherapy  in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment  is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast  prostate and other organs  Radiation therapy has several applications in non malignant conditions  such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia  acoustic neuromas  severe thyroid eye disease  pterygium  pigmented villonodular synovitis  and prevention of keloid scar growth  vascular restenosis  and heterotopic ossification  The use of radiation therapy in non malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation induced cancers RadiologyRadiology is a specialty that uses medical imaging to diagnose and treat diseases seen within the body  A variety of imaging techniques such as X ray radiography  ultrasound  computed tomography  CT   nuclear medicine including positron emission tomography  PET   and magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  are used to diagnose and or treat diseases  Interventional radiology is the performance of  usually minimally invasive  medical procedures with the guidance of imaging technologies  The acquisition of medical images is usually carried out by the Radiographer  often known as a Radiologic Technologist  Depending on location  the Diagnostic Radiologist  or Reporting Radiographer  then interprets or  reads  the images and produces a report of their findings and impression or diagnosis  This report is then transmitted to the Clinician who requested the imaging  either routinely or emergently  Imaging exams are stored digitally in the picture archiving and communication system  PACS  where they can be viewed by all members of the healthcare team within the same health system and compared later on with future imaging exams Reference rangeIn health related fields  a reference range or reference interval is the range of values for a physiologic measurement in healthy persons  for example  the amount of creatinine in the blood  or the partial pressure of oxygen   It is a basis for comparison  a frame of reference  for a physician or other health professional to interpret a set of test results for a particular patient  Some important reference ranges in medicine are reference ranges for blood tests and reference ranges for urine tests  The standard definition of a reference range  usually referred to if not otherwise specified  originates in what is most prevalent in a reference group taken from the general  i e  total  population  This is the general reference range  However  there are also optimal health ranges  ranges that appear to have the optimal health impact  and ranges for particular conditions or statuses  such as pregnancy reference ranges for hormone levels   Values within the reference range  WRR  are those within the normal distribution and are thus often described as within normal limits  WNL   The limits of the normal distribution are called the upper reference limit  URL  or upper limit of normal  ULN  and the lower reference limit  LRL  or lower limit of normal  LLN   In health care related publishing  style sheets sometimes prefer the word reference over the word normal to prevent the nontechnical senses of normal from being conflated with the statistical sense  Values outside a reference range are not necessarily pathologic  and they are not necessarily abnormal in any sense other than statistically  Nonetheless  they are indicators of probable pathosis  Sometimes the underlying cause is obvious  in other cases  challenging differential diagnosis is required to determine what is wrong and thus how to treat it Reproductive biologyReproductive biology is a study mainly involving the reproductive system and sex organs  It is closely related to reproductive endocrinology and infertility  reproductive physiology and developmental biology  It is also in many countries a field of laboratory medicine including assisted reproductive technology  sperm bank and semen analysis Reproductive endocrinology and infertilityReproductive endocrinology and infertility  REI  is a surgical subspecialty of obstetrics and gynecology that trains physicians in reproductive medicine addressing hormonal functioning as it pertains to reproduction as well as the issue of infertility  While most REI specialists primarily focus on the treatment of infertility  reproductive endocrinologists are trained to also evaluate and treat hormonal dysfunctions in females and males outside infertility  Reproductive endocrinologists have specialty training in obstetrics and gynecology  ob gyn  before they undergo sub specialty training  fellowship  in REI  Reproductive surgery is a related specialty  where a physician in ob gyn or urology further specializes to operate on anatomical disorders that affect fertility Reproductive medicineReproductive medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with prevention  diagnosis and management of reproductive problems  goals include improving or maintaining reproductive health and allowing people to have children at a time of their choosing  It is founded on knowledge of reproductive anatomy  physiology  and endocrinology  and incorporates relevant aspects of molecular biology  biochemistry and pathology Reproductive surgeryReproductive surgery is using surgery in the field of reproductive medicine  It can be used for contraception  e g  in vasectomy  wherein the vasa deferentia of a man are severed  but is also used plentifully in assisted reproductive technology  A reproductive surgeon is an obstetrician gynecologist or urologist who specializes in reproductive surgery Residency  medicine Residency is a stage of graduate medical training  A resident or house officer is a physician  one who holds the degree of M D   D O   or MBBS  MBChB  or BMed  who practices medicine usually in a hospital or clinic under the direct or indirect supervision of an attending physician  Successful completion of a residency program is a requirement to obtaining an unrestricted license to practice medicine in many jurisdictions  Residency training may be followed by fellowship or  sub specialty  training  Whereas medical school teaches physicians a broad range of medical knowledge  basic clinical skills  and supervised experience practicing medicine in a variety of fields  medical residency gives in depth training within a specific branch of medicine  A physician may choose a residency in anesthesiology  ophthalmology  cardiothoracic surgery  dermatology  emergency medicine  family medicine  internal medicine  neurology  neurosurgery  obstetrics and gynecology  otolaryngology  pathology  pediatrics  plastic and reconstructive surgery  psychiatry  physical medicine and rehabilitation  radiology  radiation oncology  oral and maxillofacial surgery  general surgery  urology or other medical specialties RheumatologyRheumatology  Greek        rheuma  flowing current  is a sub specialty in internal medicine  devoted to diagnosis and therapy of rheumatic diseases  Physicians who specialize in rheumatology are called rheumatologists  Rheumatologists deal mainly with clinical problems involving joints  soft tissues  autoimmune diseases  vasculitis  and heritable connective tissue disorders  Many of these diseases are now known to be disorders of the immune system  Rheumatology is increasingly the study of immunology  One of the major changes in modern rheumatology is the development of new drugs called biologics  or disease modifying agents  which can control severe disease more effectively Semen analysisA semen analysis  plural  semen analyses   also called  seminogram  evaluates certain characteristics of a male s semen and the sperm contained therein  It is done to help evaluate male fertility  whether for those seeking pregnancy or verifying the success of vasectomy  Depending on the measurement method  just a few characteristics may be evaluated  such as with a home kit  or many characteristics may be evaluated  generally by a diagnostic laboratory   Collection techniques and precise measurement method may influence results SerologySerology is the scientific study of serum and other bodily fluids  In practice  the term usually refers to the diagnostic identification of antibodies in the serum  Such antibodies are typically formed in response to an infection  against a given microorganism   against other foreign proteins  in response  for example  to a mismatched blood transfusion   or to one s own proteins  in instances of autoimmune disease   Serological tests may be performed for diagnostic purposes when an infection is suspected  in rheumatic illnesses  and in many other situations  such as checking an individual s blood type  Serology blood tests help to diagnose patients with certain immune deficiencies associated with the lack of antibodies  such as X linked agammaglobulinemia  In such cases  tests for antibodies will be consistently negative  There are several serology techniques that can be used depending on the antibodies being studied  These include  ELISA  agglutination  precipitation  complement fixation  and fluorescent antibodies and more recently chemiluminescence  Some serological tests are not limited to blood serum  but can also be performed on other bodily fluids such as semen and saliva  and Spinal fluid  CSF  which may contain antibodies  Serological tests may also be used in forensic serology  specifically for a piece of evidence  e g   linking a rapist to a semen sample  Sexual medicineSexual medicine is a medical specialty that deals with sexual health  At times heavily influenced by current local views on morality  with heavy cultural overlay  in broad terms this specialty is concerned with diagnosing  assessing and treating all aspects which relate to sexuality  Issues can be divided into two main areas of concern  disorders of the sexual organs disorders of the psyche affecting sexuality Sexual medicine has four dimensions  The promotional dimension  increases awareness and helps individuals have a healthy and fulfilling sex life  The preventive dimension  counseling  The curative dimension  clinical treatment of specific sexual disorders  The rehabilitative dimension  helps patients regain sexual health Sleep medicineSleep medicine is a medical specialty or subspecialty devoted to the diagnosis and therapy of sleep disturbances and disorders  From the middle of the   th century  research has provided increasing knowledge and answered many questions about sleep wake functioning  The rapidly evolving field has become a recognized medical subspecialty in some countries  Dental sleep medicine also qualifies for board certification in some countries  Properly organized  minimum    month  postgraduate training programs are still being defined in the United States  In some countries  the sleep researchers and the physicians who treat patients may be the same people  The first sleep clinics in the United States were established in the     s by interested physicians and technicians  the study  diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea were their first tasks  As late as       virtually any American physician  with no specific training in sleep medicine  could open a sleep laboratory  Disorders and disturbances of sleep are widespread and can have significant consequences for affected individuals as well as economic and other consequences for society  The US National Transportation Safety Board has  according to Dr  Charles Czeisler  member of the Institute of Medicine and Director of the Harvard University Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine at Brigham and Women s Hospital  discovered that the leading cause       of fatal to the driver heavy truck crashes is fatigue related   though rarely associated directly with sleep disorders  such as sleep apnea   with drugs and alcohol as the number two cause        Sleep deprivation has also been a significant factor in dramatic accidents  such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill  the nuclear incidents at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island and the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger South AmericaSouth America is a continent located in the western hemisphere  mostly in the southern hemisphere  with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere  It may also be considered a subcontinent of the Americas  which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages  The reference to South America instead of other regions  like Latin America or the Southern Cone  has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics  in particular  the rise of Brazil   It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean  North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest  It includes twelve sovereign states  Argentina  Bolivia  Brazil  Chile  Colombia  Ecuador  Guyana  Paraguay  Peru  Suriname  Uruguay  and Venezuela   a part of France  French Guiana   and a non sovereign area  the Falkland Islands  a British Overseas Territory though this is disputed by Argentina   In addition to this  the ABC islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  Trinidad and Tobago  and Panama may also be considered part of South America  South America has an area of            square kilometers            sq mi   Its population as of      has been estimated at more than              South America ranks fourth in area  after Asia  Africa  and North America  and fifth in population  after Asia  Africa  Europe  and North America   Brazil is by far the most populous South American country  with more than half of the continent s population  followed by Colombia  Argentina  Venezuela and Peru  In recent decades Brazil has also concentrated half of the region s GDP and has become a first regional power  Most of the population lives near the continent s western or eastern coasts while the interior and the far south are sparsely populated  The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes mountains  in contrast  the eastern part contains both highland regions and large lowlands where rivers such as the Amazon  Orinoco  and Paran  flow  Most of the continent lies in the tropics  The continent s cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of indigenous peoples with European conquerors and immigrants and  more locally  with African slaves  Given a long history of colonialism  the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak Portuguese or Spanish  and societies and states commonly reflect Western traditions
