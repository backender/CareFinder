     Nixon visit to ChinaU S  President Richard Nixon s      visit to the People s Republic of China was an important step in formally normalizing relations between the United States and China  It marked the first time a U S  president had visited the PRC  which at that time considered the U S  one of its foes  and the visit ended    years of separation between the two sides  Before even being elected president  Nixon had talked of the need for better relations with the PRC  with which the U S  did not maintain diplomatic relations as it recognized the government of the Republic of China on Taiwan as the government of China  Early in his first term  Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger began sending subtle overtures hinting at warmer relations to the PRC government  After a series of these overtures by both countries  Kissinger flew on secret diplomatic missions to Beijing  where he met with Premier Zhou Enlai  On July           the President announced that he would visit the PRC the following year  Occurring from February    to           the visit allowed the American public to view images of China for the first time in over two decades  Throughout the week the President and his most senior advisers engaged in substantive discussions with the PRC  including a meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong  while First Lady Pat Nixon toured schools  factories and hospitals in the city of Beijing  Shanghai and Hangzhou with the large American press corps in tow  Nixon dubbed the visit  the week that changed the world   The repercussions of the Nixon visit were vast  and included a significant shift in the Cold War balance  putting the PRC with the U S  against the Soviet Union   Nixon going to China  has since become a metaphor for an unexpected or uncharacteristic action by a politician      phenomenonThe      phenomenon was a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or otherwise transformative events would occur on or around    December       This date was regarded as the end date of a       year long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar  and as such  festivities to commemorate the date took place on    December      in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization  Mexico  Guatemala  Honduras  and El Salvador   with main events at Chich n Itz  in Mexico  and Tikal in Guatemala  Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date  A New Age interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation  and that    December      would mark the beginning of a new era  Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe  Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next solar maximum  an interaction between Earth and the black hole at the center of the galaxy  or Earth s collision with a planet called Nibiru  Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose  Professional Mayanist scholars stated that no extant classic Maya accounts forecast impending doom  and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in      misrepresented Maya history and culture  while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience

stomach  tummy or midriff  constitutes the part of the body between the thorax  chest  and pelvis  in humans and in other vertebrates  The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity  In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body  it follows the thorax or cephalothorax  The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim  The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint  the intervertebral disc between L  and S   to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet  The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity  The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear AbscessAn abscess  Latin  abscessus  is a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body  Signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness  pain  warmth  and swelling  The swelling may feel fluid filled when pressed  The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling  Carbuncles and boils are types of abscess that often involve hair follicles with carbuncles being larger  They are usually caused by a bacterial infection  Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection  In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  Rarely  parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world  Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like and is confirmed by cutting it open  Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear  In abscesses around the anus  computer tomography  CT  may be important to look for deeper infection  Standard treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting it open and drainage  There does not appear to be any benefit from also using antibiotics for this type of abscess in most people who are otherwise healthy  A small amount of evidence supports not packing the cavity that remains with gauze after drainage  Closing this cavity right after draining it rather than leaving it open may speed healing without increasing the risk of the abscess returning  Sucking out the pus with a needle is often not sufficient  Skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years  Risk factors include intravenous drug use with rates reported as high as     in this population  In      in the United States     million people went to the emergency department for an abscess  In Australia around        people were hospitalized in      with the condition Academic health science centreAn academic health science s  centre  AHSC  also known as an academic health science s  system  an academic health science s  partnership or an academic medical centre  is a partnership between one or more universities and healthcare providers focusing on research  clinical services  education and training  AHSCs are intended to ensure that medical research breakthroughs lead to direct clinical benefits for patients  The organisational structures that comprise an AHSC can take a variety of forms  ranging from simple partnerships to  less frequently  fully integrated organisations with a single management board  There are currently AHSCs operating in a number of countries including Australia  Canada  the Republic of Ireland  Japan  the Netherlands  Qatar  Singapore  Sweden  the United Kingdom and the United States   Acad mie Nationale de M decineSituated at    rue Bonaparte in

alternative medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body  It is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine  TCM   TCM theory and practice are not based upon scientific knowledge  and acupuncture is a pseudoscience  There are a diverse range of acupuncture theories based on different philosophies  and techniques vary depending on the country  The method used in TCM is likely the most widespread in the US  It is most often used for pain relief  though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions  Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment  The conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent  An overview of Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions  and it suggests acupuncture may be effective only for chemotherapy induced nausea vomiting  postoperative nausea vomiting  and idiopathic headache  A systematic review of

research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain  though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture s effects are mainly due to placebo  A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias  A meta analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost effective as an adjunct to standard care  while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain  Acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single use needles  When properly delivered  it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects  Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect of the practitioner  A review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade  The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections  Since serious adverse events continue to be reported  it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the

conflict with Western beliefs were abandoned in favor of tapping needles into nerves AcupressureAcupressure  from Latin acus  needle   see acuity    pressure  n    is an alternative medicine technique similar in principle to acupuncture  It is based on the concept of life energy which flows through  meridians  in the body  In treatment  physical pressure is applied to acupuncture points with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians  Pressure may be applied by hand  by elbow  or with various devices  Some medical studies have suggested that acupressure may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting  for helping lower back pain  tension headaches  stomach ache  among other things  although such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of bias  Like many alternative medicines  it may benefit from a placebo effect  According to Quackwatch  acupressure is a dubious practice and its practitioners use irrational methods AcupunctureAcupuncture is a form of

time constitutes  short  and  recent  varies by disease and by context  but the core denotation of  acute  is always qualitatively in contrast with  chronic   which denotes long lasting disease  for example  in acute leukemia and chronic leukemia   In addition   acute  also often connotes two other meanings  sudden onset and severity  such as in acute myocardial infarction  AMI   where suddenness and severity are both established aspects of the meaning  It thus often connotes that the condition is fulminant  as in the AMI example   but not always  as in acute rhinitis  which is usually synonymous with the common cold   The one thing that acute MI and acute rhinitis have in common is that they are not chronic  They can happen again  as in recurrent pneumonia  that is  multiple acute pneumonia episodes   but they are not the same case ongoing for months or years  unlike chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  which is   A noncount sense of  acute disease  refers to the acute phase  that is  a short course  of any disease entity  For example  in an article on ulcerative enteritis in poultry  the author says   in acute disease there may be increased mortality without any obvious signs   referring to the acute form or phase of ulcerative enteritis AdenosineAdenosine is a purine nucleoside composed of a molecule of adenine attached to a ribose sugar molecule  ribofuranose  moiety via a   N  glycosidic bond  Adenosine is widely found in nature and plays an important role in biochemical processes  such as energy transfer as adenosine triphosphate  ATP  and adenosine diphosphate  ADP  as well as in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate  cAMP   It is also a neuromodulator  believed to play a role in promoting sleep and suppressing arousal  Adenosine also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation  In addition to adenosine s endogenous forms  it is also used as a medication  specifically  as an antiarrhythmic agent  to treat a number of forms of supraventricular tachycardia that do not improve with vagal maneuvers  Common side effects include chest pain  feeling faint  shortness of breath along with tingling of the senses   Serious side effects include a worsening dysrhythmia and low blood pressure  It appears to be safe in pregnancy Adenosine A  receptorThe adenosine A  receptor is one member of the adenosine receptor group of G protein coupled receptors with adenosine as endogenous ligand Adverse effectIn medicine  an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery  An adverse effect may be termed a  side effect   when judged to be secondary to a main or therapeutic effect  If it results from an unsuitable or incorrect dosage or procedure  this is called a medical error and not a complication  Adverse effects are sometimes referred to as  iatrogenic  because they are generated by a physician treatment  Some adverse effects occur only when starting  increasing or discontinuing a treatment  Using a drug or other medical intervention which is contraindicated may increase the risk of adverse effects  Adverse effects may cause complications of a disease or procedure and negatively affect its prognosis  They may also lead to non compliance with a treatment regimen  Adverse effects of medical treatment resulted in         deaths in      up from        deaths in      globally  The harmful outcome is usually indicated by some result such as morbidity  mortality  alteration in body weight  levels of enzymes  loss of function  or as a pathological change detected at the microscopic  macroscopic or physiological level  It may also be indicated by symptoms reported by a patient  Adverse effects may cause a reversible or irreversible change  including an increase or decrease in the susceptibility of the individual to other chemicals  foods  or procedures  such as drug interactions AlchemyAlchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe  Egypt and Asia  It aimed to purify  mature  and perfect certain objects  Common aims were chrysopoeia  the transmutation of  base metals   e g   lead  into  noble  ones  particularly gold   the creation of an elixir of immortality  the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease  and the development of an alkahest  a universal solvent  The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and  in the Hellenistic and western tradition  the achievement of gnosis  In Europe  the creation of a philosopher s stone was variously connected with all of these projects  In English  the term is often limited to descriptions of European alchemy  but similar practices existed in the Far East  the Indian subcontinent  and the Muslim world  In Europe  following the   th century Renaissance produced by the translation of Arabic works on science and the Recovery of Aristotle  alchemists played a significant role in early modern science  particularly chemistry and medicine   Islamic and European alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques  theory  terminology  and experimental method  some of which are still in use today  However  they continued antiquity s belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers and cryptic symbolism  Their work was guided by Hermetic principles related to magic  mythology  and religion  Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects  despite the arguments of scholars like Holmyard and von Franz that they should be understood as complementary  The former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry  medicine  and charlatanism  and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred  The latter interests historians of esotericism  psychologists  and some philosophers and spiritualists  The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts  Despite this split  which von Franz believes has existed since the Western traditions  origin in a mix of Greek philosophy that was mixed with Egyptian and Mesopotamian technology  numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as Pseudo Democritus s first century AD On Physical and Mystical Matters  Greek  Physika kai Mystika  Alcohol dependenceAlcohol dependence is a previous psychiatric diagnosis in which an individual is physically or psychologically dependent upon drinking alcohol  In      it was reclassified as alcohol use disorder  alcoholism  along with alcohol abuse in DSM   Allen   UnwinAllen   Unwin is an Australian independent publishing company  established in Australia in      as a subsidiary of the British firm George Allen   Unwin Ltd   which was founded by Sir Stanley Unwin in August      and went on to become one of the leading publishers of the twentieth century AllergyAllergies  also known as allergic diseases  are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to something in the environment that usually causes little or no problem in most people  These diseases include hay fever  food allergies  atopic dermatitis  allergic asthma  and anaphylaxis  Symptoms may include red eyes  an itchy rash  runny nose  shortness of breath  or swelling  Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions  Common allergens include pollen and certain food  Metals and other substances may also cause problems  Food  insect stings  and medications are common causes of severe reactions  Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors  The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies  IgE   part of the body s immune system  binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine  Diagnosis is typically based on a person s medical history  Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases  Positive tests  however  may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question  Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective  Treatments for allergies include avoiding known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines  In severe reactions injectable adrenaline  epinephrine  is recommended  Allergen immunotherapy  which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen  is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites  Its use in food allergies is unclear  Allergies are common  In the developed world  about     of people are affected by allergic rhinitis  about    of people have at least one food allergy  and about     have atopic dermatitis at some point in time  Depending on the country about       of people have asthma  Anaphylaxis occurs in between         of people  Rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing  The word  allergy  was first used by Clemens von Pirquet in      Alternative medicineAlternative medicine or fringe medicine are practices claimed to have the healing effects of medicine but which are disproven  unproven  or impossible to prove  or are excessively harmful in relation to their effect  and where the scientific consensus is that the therapy does not  or can not  work because the known laws of nature are violated by its basic claims  or where it is considered so much worse than conventional treatment that it would be unethical to offer as treatment  Alternative therapies or diagnoses are not part of medicine or science based healthcare systems  Alternative medicine consists of a wide variety of practices  products  and therapies ranging from those that are biologically plausible but not well tested  to those with known harmful and toxic effects  Contrary to popular belief  significant expense is paid to test alternative medicine  including over      billion spent by the United States government  Almost none show any effect beyond that of false treatment  Perceived effects of alternative medicine may be caused by placebo  decreased effect of functional treatment  and therefore potentially decreased side effects   and regression toward the mean where improvement that would have occurred anyway is credited to alternative therapies  or any combination of the above  Alternative treatments are neither the same as experimental medicine  nor traditional medicine   although the latter  when used today may be considered alternative  Alternative medicine has grown in popularity and is used by a significant percentage of the population in many countries  While it has extensively rebranded itself  from quackery to complementary or integrative medicine it promotes essentially the same practices  Newer proponents often suggest alternative medicine be used together with functional medical treatment  in a belief that it  complements   improves the effect of  or mitigates the side effects of  the treatment  There is no evidence showing they do so  and significant drug interactions caused by alternative therapies may instead negatively influence treatments  making them less effective  notably cancer therapy  Despite being illegal to market alternative therapies for cancer treatment in most of the developed world  many cancer patients use them  Alternative medical diagnoses and treatments are not taught as part of science based curricula in medical schools  and are not used in any practice where treatment is based on scientific knowledge or proven experience  Alternative therapies are often based on religion  tradition  superstition  belief in supernatural energies  pseudoscience  errors in reasoning  propaganda  fraud  or lies  Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine and health care providers varies between and within countries  Alternative medicine is criticized for being based on misleading statements  quackery  pseudoscience  antiscience  fraud  or poor scientific methodology  Promoting alternative medicine has been called dangerous and unethical  Testing alternative medicine that has no scientific basis has been called a waste of scarce research resources  Critics state  there is really no such thing as alternative medicine  just medicine that works and medicine that doesn t   and the problem with the idea of  alternative  treatments in this sense is that the  underlying logic is magical  childish or downright absurd   It has been strongly suggested that very idea of any alternative treatment that works is paradoxical  as any treatment proven to work is by definition  medicine  Alzheimer s diseaseAlzheimer s disease  AD   also referred to simply as Alzheimer s  is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time  It is the cause of     to     of cases of dementia  The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events  short term memory loss   As the disease advances  symptoms can include problems with language  disorientation  including easily getting lost   mood swings  loss of motivation  not managing self care  and behavioural issues  As a person s condition declines  they often withdraw from family and society  Gradually  bodily functions are lost  ultimately leading to death  Although the speed of progression can vary  the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years  The cause of Alzheimer s disease is poorly understood  About     of the risk is believed to be genetic with many genes usually involved  Other risk factors include a history of head injuries  depression  or hypertension  The disease process is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain  A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes  Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing  Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis  Mental and physical exercise  and avoiding obesity may decrease the risk of AD  There are no medications or supplements that decrease risk  No treatments stop or reverse its progression  though some may temporarily improve symptoms  Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance  often placing a burden on the caregiver  the pressures can include social  psychological  physical  and economic elements  Exercise programmes may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes  Treatment of behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common but not usually recommended due to there often being little benefit and an increased risk of early death  In       there were approximately    million people worldwide with AD  It most often begins in people over    years of age  although    to    of cases are early onset Alzheimer s which begin before this  It affects about    of people    years and older  In       dementia resulted in about         deaths  It was first described by  and later named after  German psychiatrist and pathologist Alois Alzheimer in       In developed countries  AD is one of the most financially costly diseases American Cancer SocietyThe American Cancer Society  ACS  is a nationwide voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer  Established in       the society is organized into eleven geographical divisions of both medical and lay volunteers operating in more than     offices throughout the United States  Its home office is located in the American Cancer Society Center in Atlanta  Georgia  The ACS publishes the journals Cancer  CA  A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Cancer Cytopathology   American College of PhysiciansThe American College of Physicians  ACP  is a national organization of internal medicine physicians  internists  specialists who apply scientific knowledge and clinical expertise to the diagnosis  treatment  and compassionate care of adults across the spectrum from health to complex illness  With         members  ACP is the largest medical specialty organization and second largest physician group in the United States American Society of AnesthesiologistsThe American Society of Anesthesiologists  ASA  is an educational  research and scientific association of physicians organized to raise the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology and to improve patient care  As of       the organization included more than        national and international members and has more than     full time employees Ancient Greek medicineAncient Greek medicine was a compilation of theories and practices that were constantly expanding through new ideologies and trials  Many components were considered in ancient Greek medicine  intertwining the spiritual with the physical  Specifically  the ancient Greeks believed health was affected by the humors  gender  geographic location  social class  diet  trauma  beliefs  and mindset  Early on  ancient Greeks believed that illnesses were  divine punishments  and that healing was a  gift from the Gods   As trials continued wherein theories were tested against symptoms and results  the pure spiritual beliefs regarding  punishments  and  gifts  were replaced with a foundation based in the physical  i e   cause and effect  Humorism  or the four humors  refers to blood  yellow bile  black bile and phlegm  It was also theorized that gender played a role in medicine because some diseases and treatments were different for women than for men  Moreover  geographic location and social class affected the living conditions of the people and might subject them to different environmental issues such as mosquitoes  rats  and availability of clean drinking water  Diet was thought to be an issue as well and might be affected by a lack of access to adequate nourishment  Trauma  such as that suffered by gladiators  from dog bites or other injuries  played a role in theories relating to understanding anatomy and infections  Additionally  there was significant focus on the beliefs and mind set of the patient in the diagnosis and treatment theories  It was recognized that the mind played a role in healing  or that it might also be the sole basis for the illness  Ancient Greek medicine began to revolve around the theory of humors  Humoral theory states that good health comes from perfect balance of the four humors blood  phlegm  yellow bile  and black bile  Consequently  poor health resulted from improper balance of the four humors  Hippocrates  known as the  Father of Modern Medicine   established a medical school at Cos and is the most important figure in ancient Greek medicine  Hippocrates and his students documented numerous illnesses in the Hippocratic Corpus  and developed the Hippocratic Oath for physicians  which is still in use today  The contributions to ancient Greek medicine of Hippocrates  Socrates and others had a lasting influence on Islamic medicine and medieval European medicine until many of their findings eventually became obsolete in the   th century  The earliest known Greek medical school opened in Cnidus in     BC  Alcmaeon  author of the first anatomical compilation  worked at this school  and it was here that the practice of observing patients was established  Despite their known respect for Egyptian medicine  attempts to discern any particular influence on Greek practice at this early time have not been dramatically successful because of the lack of sources and the challenge of understanding ancient medical terminology  It is clear  however  that the Greeks imported Egyptian substances into their pharmacopoeia  and the influence became more pronounced after the establishment of a school of Greek medicine in Alexandria Ancient astronautsAncient astronauts  or ancient aliens  is a pseudohistoric concept based on the belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity and prehistoric times  Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of modern cultures  technologies  and religions  A common claim is that deities from most  if not all  religions are extraterrestrial in origin  and that advanced technologies brought to Earth by ancient astronauts were interpreted as evidence of divine status by early humans  The idea that ancient astronauts existed is not taken seriously by academics  and has received no credible attention in peer reviewed studies  Ancient astronauts have been widely used as a plot device in science fiction  Well known proponents in the latter half of the   th century who have written numerous books or appear regularly in mass media include Erich von D niken  Zecharia Sitchin  Robert K  G  Temple  Giorgio A  Tsoukalos and David Hatcher Childress AnesthesiaIn the practice of medicine  especially surgery and dentistry   anesthesia or anaesthesia is a temporary induced loss of sensation or awareness  It may include analgesia  relief from or prevention of pain   paralysis  muscle relaxation   amnesia  loss of memory   or unconsciousness  A patient under the effects of anesthetic drugs is referred to as being anesthetized  Anesthesia enables the painless performance of medical procedures that would cause severe or intolerable pain to an unanesthetized patient  Three broad categories of anaesthesia exist  General anesthesia suppresses central nervous system activity and results in unconsciousness and total lack of sensation  Sedation suppresses the central nervous system to a lesser degree  inhibiting both anxiety and creation of long term memories without resulting in unconsciousness  Regional anesthesia and local anesthesia  which block transmission of nerve impulses between a targeted part of the body and the central nervous system  causing loss of sensation in the targeted body part  A patient under regional or local anesthesia remains conscious  unless general anaesthesia or sedation is administered at the same time  Two broad classes exist  Peripheral blockade inhibits sensory perception in an isolated part of the body  such as numbing a tooth for dental work or administering a nerve block to inhibit sensation in an entire limb  Central  or neuraxial  blockade administers the anesthetic in the region of the central nervous system itself  suppressing incoming sensation from outside the area of the block  Examples include epidural anaesthesia and spinal anaesthesia   In preparing for a medical procedure  the health care provider giving anesthesia chooses and determines the doses of one or more drugs to achieve the types and degree of anesthesia characteristics appropriate for the type of procedure and the particular patient  The types of drugs used include general anesthetics  hypnotics  sedatives  neuromuscular blocking drugs  narcotic  and analgesics  There are both major and minor risks of anesthesia  Examples of major risks include death  heart attack and pulmonary embolism whereas minor risks can include postoperative nausea and vomiting and hospital readmission  The likelihood of a complication occurring is proportional to the relative risk of a variety of factors related to the patient s health  the complexity of the surgery being performed and the type of anesthetic  Of these factors  the person s health prior to surgery  stratified by the ASA physical status classification system  has the greatest bearing on the probability of a complication occurring  Patients typically wake within minutes of an anesthetic being terminated and regain their senses within hours  One exception is a condition called long term post operative cognitive dysfunction  characterized by persistent confusion lasting weeks or months  which is more common in those undergoing cardiac surgery and in the elderly Angina pectorisAngina pectoris  commonly known as angina  is the sensation of chest pain  pressure  or squeezing  often due to not enough blood flow to the heart muscle as a result of obstruction or spasm of the coronary arteries  While angina pectoris can occur due to anemia  abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure  its main cause is coronary artery disease  an atherosclerotic process affecting the arteries feeding the heart  The term derives from the Latin angere   to strangle   and pectus   chest    and can therefore be translated as  a strangling feeling in the chest   There is a weak relationship between severity of pain and degree of oxygen deprivation in the heart muscle  i e   there can be severe pain with little or no risk of a myocardial infarction  heart attack  and a heart attack can occur without pain   In some cases  angina can be quite severe  and in the early   th century this was known to be a signal of impending death  However  given current medical therapies  the outlook has improved substantially  People with an average age of    years  who have moderate to severe degrees of angina  grading by classes II  III  and IV  have a   year survival rate of approximately      Worsening angina attacks  sudden onset angina at rest  and angina lasting more than    minutes are symptoms of unstable angina  usually grouped with similar conditions as the acute coronary syndrome   As these may precede a heart attack  they require urgent medical attention and are  in general  treated in similar fashion to myocardial infarction Anthroposophic medicineAnthroposophic medicine  or anthroposophical medicine  is a form of alternative medicine  Devised in the     s by Rudolf Steiner             in conjunction with Ita Wegman              anthroposophical medicine is based on occult notions and draws on Steiner s spiritual philosophy  which he called anthroposophy  Practitioners employ a variety of treatment techniques based upon anthroposophic precepts  including massage  exercise  counselling  and substances  Many drug preparations used in anthroposophic medicine are ultra diluted substances  similar to those used in homeopathy  Homeopathic remedies are not medically effective and are generally considered harmless  except when used as a substitute for a scientifically proven and effective cure  In certain European countries  people with cancer are sometimes prescribed remedies made from specially harvested mistletoe  but research has found no convincing evidence of clinical benefit  Some anthroposophic doctors oppose childhood vaccination  and this has led to preventable outbreaks of disease  Professor of complementary medicine Edzard Ernst and other critics have characterized anthroposophic medicine as having no basis in science  pseudoscientific  and quackery  Anthroposophic medicine departs from fundamental biological principles in several respects  For example  it claims that the heart does not pump blood but that blood propels itself along  Anthroposophic medicine also proposes that a patient s past lives may influence their illness and that the course of an illness is subject to karmic destiny AnticoagulantAnticoagulants  commonly referred to as blood thinners  are substances that prevent or reduce coagulation of blood  prolonging the clotting time  Some of them occur naturally in blood eating animals such as leeches and mosquitoes  where they help keep the bite area unclotted long enough for the animal to obtain some blood  As a class of medications  anticoagulants are used in therapy for thrombotic disorders  Oral anticoagulants  OACs  are taken by many people in pill or tablet form  and various intravenous anticoagulant dosage forms are used in hospitals  Some anticoagulants are used in medical equipment  such as test tubes  serum separating tubes  blood transfusion bags  and dialysis equipment  Anticoagulants are closely related to antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytic drugs by manipulating the various pathways of blood coagulation  Specifically  antiplatelet drugs inhibit platelet aggregation  clumping together   whereas anticoagulants inhibit the coagulation cascade by clotting factors that happens after the initial platelet aggregation  Common anticoagulants include warfarin and heparin AntiemeticAn antiemetic is a drug that is effective against vomiting and nausea  Antiemetics are typically used to treat motion sickness and the side effects of opioid analgesics  general anaesthetics  and chemotherapy directed against cancer  They may be used for severe cases of gastroenteritis  especially if the patient is dehydrated  Antiemetics  though previously thought to cause birth defects  have been proven safe for use by pregnant women in the treatment of morning sickness and the more serious hyperemesis gravidarum AntiscienceAntiscience is a position that rejects science and the scientific method  People holding antiscientific views do not accept that science is an objective method  or that it generates universal knowledge  They also contend that scientific reductionism in particular is an inherently limited means to reach understanding of the complex world we live in Applied kinesiologyApplied kinesiology  AK  is a technique in alternative medicine claimed to be able to diagnose illness or choose treatment by testing muscles for strength and weakness  According to their guidelines on allergy diagnostic testing  the American College of Allergy  Asthma and Immunology stated there is  no evidence of diagnostic validity  of applied kinesiology  Another study has shown that  as an evaluative method  AK  is no more useful than random guessing   and the American Cancer Society has said that  scientific evidence does not support the claim that applied kinesiology can diagnose or treat cancer or other illness  ArgyriaArgyria or argyrosis  from Ancient Greek          argyros silver  is a condition caused by inappropriate exposure to chemical compounds of the element silver  or to silver dust  The most dramatic symptom of argyria is that the skin turns blue or bluish grey  It may take the form of generalized argyria or local argyria  Generalized argyria affects large areas over much of the visible surface of the body  Local argyria shows in limited regions of the body  such as patches of skin  parts of the mucous membrane or the conjunctiva  The terms argyria and argyrosis have long been used interchangeably  with argyria being used more frequently  Argyrosis has been used particularly in referring to argyria of the conjunctiva  but the usage has never been consistent and cannot be relied on except where it has been explicitly specified   Aryan raceThe Aryan race was a racial grouping term used in the period of the late   th century to the mid   th century to describe multiple peoples  It has been variously used to describe all Indo Europeans in general  spanning from India to Europe   the original Aryan people specifically in Persia  and most controversially through Nazi misinterpretation  the Nordic or Germanic peoples  The term derives from the Aryan people  from Persia  who spoke a language similar to those that have been found in Europe  While originally meant simply as a neutral ethno linguistic classification  from the late   th century onwards the term Aryan race has been used by people who promoted ideas about racial hierarchy  like the Nazis  who thought that the Germanic peoples were  in comparison to other peoples in the world  predominately descended from an ancient master race  whom they called  Aryan   Aryanism developed as a racial ideology based on this idea Aspartame controversyThe artificial sweetener aspartame has been the subject of several controversies since its initial approval by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  in       The FDA approval of aspartame was highly contested  with critics alleging that the quality of the initial research supporting its safety was inadequate and flawed and that conflicts of interest marred the      approval of aspartame  In       the U S  Government Accountability Office concluded that the food additive approval process had been followed properly for aspartame  The irregularities fueled a conspiracy theory  which the  Nancy Markle  email hoax circulated  along with claims  counter to the weight of medical evidence  that numerous health conditions  such as multiple sclerosis  systemic lupus  methanol toxicity  blindness  spasms  shooting pains  seizures  headaches  depression  anxiety  memory loss  birth defects  and death  are caused by the consumption of aspartame in normal doses  Potential health risks have been examined and dismissed by numerous scientific research projects  With the exception of the risk to those with phenylketonuria  aspartame is considered to be a safe food additive by governments worldwide and major health and food safety organizations  FDA officials describe aspartame as  one of the most thoroughly tested and studied food additives the agency has ever approved  and its safety as  clear cut   The weight of existing scientific evidence indicates that aspartame is safe as a non nutritive sweetener AsthmaAsthma is a common long term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs  It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms  reversible airflow obstruction  and bronchospasm  Symptoms include episodes of wheezing  coughing  chest tightness  and shortness of breath  These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week  Depending on the person they may become worse at night or with exercise  Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors  Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens  Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers  Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms  response to therapy over time  and spirometry  Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms  forced expiratory volume in one second  FEV    and peak expiratory flow rate  It may also be classified as atopic or non atopic where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type   hypersensitivity reaction  There is no cure for asthma  Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers  such as allergens and irritants  and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids  Long acting beta agonists  LABA  or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled  Treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short acting beta   agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth  In very severe cases  intravenous corticosteroids  magnesium sulfate  and hospitalization may be required  In           million people globally had asthma up from     million in       It caused about         deaths in       most of which occurred in the developing world  It often begins in childhood  The rates of asthma have increased significantly since the     s  Asthma was recognized as early as Ancient Egypt  The word asthma is from the Greek         sthma which means  panting  AstrologyAstrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events  Astrology has been dated to at least the  nd millennium BCE  and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications  Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events  and some   such as the Indians  Chinese  and Maya   developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations  Western astrology  one of the oldest astrological systems still in use  can trace its roots to   th   th century BCE Mesopotamia  from which it spread to Ancient Greece  Rome  the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe  Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person s personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects  the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems  Throughout most of its history astrology was considered a scholarly tradition and was common in academic circles  often in close relation with astronomy  alchemy  meteorology  and medicine  It was present in political circles  and is mentioned in various works of literature  from Dante Alighieri and Geoffrey Chaucer to William Shakespeare  Lope de Vega and Calder n de la Barca  With the onset of the scientific revolution astrology was called into question  it has been challenged successfully both on theoretical and experimental grounds  and has been shown to have no scientific validity or explanatory power  Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing  and common belief in it has largely declined  Astrology is now recognized to be pseudoscience Attention deficit hyperactivity disorderAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder  ADHD  is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type  It is characterized by problems paying attention  excessive activity  or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person s age  These symptoms begin by age six to twelve  are present for more than six months  and cause problems in at least two settings  such as school  home  or recreational activities   In children  problems paying attention may result in poor school performance  Although it causes impairment  particularly in modern society  many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting  Despite being the most commonly studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents  the exact cause is unknown in the majority of cases  It affects about      of children when diagnosed via the DSM IV criteria and      when diagnosed via the ICD    criteria  The World Health Organization  WHO  estimated that it affected about    million people as of       Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed  ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls  although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys  About        of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between      of adults have the condition  The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other disorders  as well as to distinguish from high levels of activity that are still within the normal range  ADHD management recommendations vary by country and usually involve some combination of counseling  lifestyle changes  and medications  The British guideline only recommends medications as a first line treatment in children who have severe symptoms and for medication to be considered in those with moderate symptoms who either refuse or fail to improve with counseling  though for adults medications are a first line treatment  Canadian and American guidelines recommend that medications and behavioral therapy be used together as a first line therapy  except in preschool aged children  Stimulant medication therapy is not recommended as a first line therapy in preschool aged children in either guideline  Treatment with stimulants is effective for up to    months  however  its long term effectiveness is unclear  Adolescents and adults tend to develop coping skills which make up for some or all of their impairments  The medical literature has described symptoms similar to ADHD since the   th century  ADHD  its diagnosis  and its treatment have been considered controversial since the     s  The controversies have involved clinicians  teachers  policymakers  parents  and the media  Topics include ADHD s causes and the use of stimulant medications in its treatment  Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder in children and adults  and the debate in the scientific community mainly centers on how it is diagnosed and treated  The condition was officially known as attention deficit disorder  ADD  from      to      while before this it was known as hyperkinetic reaction of childhood AuriculotherapyAuriculotherapy  or auricular therapy  or ear acupuncture  or auriculoacupuncture is a form of alternative medicine based on the idea that the ear is a microsystem which reflects the entire body  represented on the auricle  the outer portion of the ear  Conditions affecting the physical  mental or emotional health of the patient are assumed to be treatable by stimulation of the surface of the ear exclusively  Similar mappings are used in many areas of the body  including the practices of reflexology and iridology  These mappings were not originally based on or supported by any medical or scientific evidence AutismAutism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction  verbal and non verbal communication  and restricted and repetitive behavior  Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life  These signs often develop gradually  though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress  The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood  typically before age three  Autism is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors  Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine  Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes  for example  the vaccine hypotheses  which have since been disproven  Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize  how this occurs is not well understood  In the DSM V  autism is included within the autism spectrum  ASDs   as is Asperger syndrome  which lacks delays in cognitive development and language  and pervasive developmental disorder  not otherwise specified  commonly abbreviated as PDD NOS   which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met  Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self care  social  and communication skills  Although there is no known cure  there have been reported cases of children who recovered  Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood  though some become successful  An autistic culture has developed  with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder  Globally  autism is estimated to affect      million people as of       As of       the number of people affected is estimated at about     per       worldwide  It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls  About      of children in the United States  one in     are diagnosed with ASD as of       a     increase from one in    in       The rate of autism among adults aged    years and over in the United Kingdom is       The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the     s  partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses  the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved AyurvedaAyurveda  Sanskrit             yurveda   life knowledge   English pronunciation   a   r ve d     or Ayurveda medicine  is a system of medicine with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent  Globalized and modernized practices derived from Ayurveda traditions are a type of complementary or alternative medicine  In the Western world  Ayurveda therapies and practices  which are manifold  have been integrated in general wellness applications and as well in some cases in medical use  The main classical Ayurveda texts begin with accounts of the transmission of medical knowledge from the Gods to sages  and then to human physicians  In Sushruta Samhita   Sushruta s Compendium    Sushruta wrote that Dhanvantari  Hindu god of Ayurveda  incarnated himself as a king of Varanasi and taught medicine to a group of physicians  including Sushruta  Ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia  Therapies are typically based on complex herbal compounds  minerals and metal substances  perhaps under the influence of early Indian alchemy or rasa shastra   Ancient Ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques  including rhinoplasty  kidney stone extractions  sutures  and the extraction of foreign objects  Although laboratory experiments suggest it is possible that some substances used in Ayurveda might be developed into effective treatments  there is no evidence that any are effective as currently practiced  Ayurveda medicine is considered pseudoscientific  Other researchers consider it a protoscience  or trans science system instead  Close to     of Ayurveda U S  and Indian manufactured patent medicines sold through the Internet were found to contain toxic levels of heavy metals  specifically lead  mercury  and arsenic  The public health implications of such metallic contaminants in India are unknown  Some scholars assert that Ayurveda originated in prehistoric times  and that some of the concepts of Ayurveda have existed from the time of the Indus Valley Civilization or even earlier  Ayurveda developed significantly during the Vedic period and later some of the non Vedic systems such as Buddhism and Jainism also developed medical concepts and practices that appear in the classical Ayurveda texts  Humoral balance is emphasized  and suppressing natural urges is considered unhealthy and claimed to lead to illness  Ayurveda names three elemental substances  the doshas  called Vata  Pitta and Kapha   and states that a balance of the doshas results in health  while imbalance results in disease  Ayurveda has eight canonical components  which are derived from classical Sanskrit literature  Ayurveda practitioners had developed various medicinal preparations and surgical procedures by the medieval period BBCThe British Broadcasting Corporation  BBC  is a British public service broadcaster  It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London  is the world s oldest national broadcasting organisation  and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees  with over        staff in total  of whom        are in public sector broadcasting  when part time  flexible and fixed contract staff are included  the total number is         The BBC is established under a Royal Charter and operates under its Agreement with the Secretary of State for Culture  Media and Sport  Its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee which is charged to all British households  companies  and organisations using any type of equipment to receive or record live television broadcasts  The fee is set by the British Government  agreed by Parliament  and used to fund the BBC s radio  TV  and online services covering the nations and regions of the UK  Since   April       it has also funded the BBC World Service  launched in      as the BBC Empire Service   which broadcasts in    languages and provides comprehensive TV  radio  and online services in Arabic  and Persian  Around a quarter of BBC revenues come from its commercial arm BBC Worldwide Ltd  which sells BBC programmes and services internationally and also distributes the BBC s international    hour English language news services BBC World News  and from BBC com  provided by BBC Global News Ltd The BMJThe BMJ is a weekly peer reviewed medical journal  It is one of the world s oldest general medical journals  Originally called the British Medical Journal  the title was officially shortened to BMJ in       and then changed to The BMJ in       The journal is published by BMJ Group  a wholly owned subsidiary of the British Medical Association  The editor in chief of The BMJ is Fiona Godlee  who was appointed in February      Baby colicBaby colic  also known as infantile colic  is defined as episodes of crying for more than three hours a day  for more than three days a week  for three weeks in an otherwise healthy child  Often crying occurs in the evening  It typically does not result in long term problems  The crying can cause frustration for the parents  depression following delivery  excess visits to the doctor  and child abuse  The cause of colic is unknown  Some believe it is due to gastrointestinal discomfort like intestinal cramping  Diagnosis requires ruling out other possible causes  Concerning findings include a fever  poor activity  or a swollen abdomen  Fewer than    of infants with excess crying have an underlying organic disease  Treatment is generally conservative  with little to no role for either medications or alternative therapies  Extra support for the parents may be useful  Tentative evidence supports certain probiotics for the baby and a low allergen diet by the mother in those who are breastfed  Hydrolyzed formula may be useful in those who are bottlefeed  Colic affects        of children  It is most common at six weeks of age and typically goes away by six months of age  It rarely lasts up to one year of age  It occurs at the same rate in boys and in girls  The first detailed medical description of the problem occurred in      Pathogenic bacteriaPathogenic bacteria are bacteria that can cause infection  This article deals with human pathogenic bacteria  Although most bacteria are harmless or often beneficial  some are pathogenic  One of the bacterial diseases with the highest disease burden is tuberculosis  caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis  which kills about   million people a year  mostly in sub Saharan Africa  Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases  such as pneumonia  which can be caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus and Pseudomonas  and foodborne illnesses  which can be caused by bacteria such as Shigella  Campylobacter  and Salmonella  Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as tetanus  typhoid fever  diphtheria  syphilis  and leprosy  Pathogenic bacteria are also the cause of high infant mortality rates in developing countries  Koch s postulates are the standard to establish a causative relationship between a microbe and a disease Bates methodThe Bates method is an alternative therapy aimed at improving eyesight  Eye care physician William Horatio Bates  M D              attributed nearly all sight problems to habitual strain of the eyes  and felt that glasses were harmful and never necessary  Bates self published a book  Perfect Sight Without Glasses  as well as a magazine  Better Eyesight Magazine   and earlier collaborated with Bernarr MacFadden on a correspondence course  detailing his approach to helping people relax such  strain   and thus  he claimed  improve their sight  His techniques centered on visualization and movement  He placed particular emphasis on imagining black letters and marks  and the movement of such  He also felt that exposing the eyes to sunlight would help alleviate the  strain   Despite continued anecdotal reports of successful results  including well publicised support by Aldous Huxley  Bates  techniques have not been objectively shown to improve eyesight  His main physiological proposition that the eyeball changes shape to maintain focus has consistently been contradicted by observation  In       optometry professor Elwin Marg wrote of Bates   Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists   Marg concluded that the Bates method owed its popularity largely to  flashes of clear vision  experienced by many who followed it  Such occurrences have since been explained as a contact lens like effect of moisture on the eye  or a flattening of the lens by the ciliary muscles  The Bates method has been criticized not only because there is no good evidence it works  but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it  they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight  put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving  or neglect conventional eye care  possibly allowing serious conditions to develop BaunscheidtismBaunscheidtism is a form of alternative medicine created in the   th century  The practice  a form of homeopathy  is named for its founder Carl Baunscheidt              a German mechanic and inventor   The legitimacy of baunscheidtism as an effective medical practice was questioned by at least       when a Melbourne practitioner named Samuel Fischer lost a lawsuit he brought against a patient who failed to pay him  based on the objection that Fischer  a bootmaker  was not a qualified medical practitioner ApitoxinApitoxin  or honey bee venom  is a bitter colourless liquid  its active portion a mixture of proteins  which causes local inflammation and acts as an anticoagulant  A honeybee can inject     mg of venom via its stinger  It may have similarities to sea nettle toxin Harvard University PressHarvard University Press  HUP  is a publishing house established on January           as a division of Harvard University  and focused on academic publishing  In       it published     new titles  It is a member of the Association of American University Presses  Its current director is William P  Sisler and the editor in chief is Susan Wallace Boehmer  The press maintains offices in Cambridge  Massachusetts  near Harvard Square  in New York City  and in London  England  Notable authors

to control the facial muscles on the affected side  Symptoms can vary from mild to severe  They may include muscle twitching  weakness  or total loss of the ability to move one or rarely both sides of the face  Other symptoms include drooping of the eyelid  a change in taste  pain around the ear  and increased sensitivity to sound  Typically symptoms come on over    hours  The cause of Bell s palsy is unknown  Risk factors include diabetes and a recent upper respiratory tract infection  It results from a dysfunction of cranial nerve VII  the facial nerve   Many believe that this is due to a viral infection that results in swelling  Diagnosis is based on a person s appearance and ruling out other possible causes  Other conditions that can cause facial weakness include brain tumor  stroke  Ramsay Hunt syndrome  and Lyme disease  The condition normally gets better by itself with most achieving normal or near normal function  Corticosteroids have been found to improve outcomes  while antiviral medications may be of a small additional benefit  The eye should be protected from drying up with the use of eye drops or an eyepatch  Surgery is generally not recommended  Often signs of improvement begin within    days  with complete recovery within six months  A few may not recover completely or have a recurrence of symptoms  Bell s palsy is the most common cause of one sided facial nerve paralysis        It occurs in   to   per        people per year  About      of people are affected at some point in their life  It most commonly occurs in people between ages    and     Males and females are affected equally  It is named after Scottish surgeon Charles Bell              who first described the connection of the facial nerve to the condition Bian QueBian Que  Chinese      pinyin  Bi n Qu    also pronounced Pien Chueh  Wade Giles  Pien Ch iao  died     BC  was  according to legend  the earliest known Chinese physician  His real name is said to be Qin Yueren        but his medical skills were so amazing that the people gave him the same name as the legendary doctor Bian Que  from the time of the Yellow Emperor  He was a native of the State of Qi Bian stonesBian stones are pointed stones that were historically used in traditional Chinese medicine  They are generally considered to be a precursor to acupuncture  utilising heated pointed stones  instead of acupuncture needles  in the treatment of back and neck pain  The stones are made from a variety of materials found along the coastline of Shandong  China   Biodynamic agricultureBiodynamic agriculture is a form of alternative agriculture very similar to organic farming  but it includes various esoteric concepts drawn from the ideas of Rudolf Steiner              Initially developed since       it was the first of the organic agriculture movements  It treats soil fertility  plant growth  and livestock care as ecologically interrelated tasks  emphasizing spiritual and mystical perspectives  Biodynamics has much in common with other organic approaches   it emphasizes the use of manures and composts and excludes the use of artificial chemicals on soil and plants  Methods unique to the biodynamic approach include its treatment of animals  crops  and soil as a single system  an emphasis from its beginnings on local production and distribution systems  its use of traditional and development of new local breeds and varieties  Some methods use an astrological sowing and planting calendar  Biodynamic agriculture uses various herbal and mineral additives for compost additives and field sprays  these are sometimes prepared by controversial methods  such as burying ground quartz stuffed into the horn of a cow  which are said to harvest  cosmic forces in the soil   that are more akin to sympathetic magic than agronomy  As of      biodynamic techniques were used on         hectares in    countries  Germany accounts for     of the global total  the remainder average      ha per country  Biodynamic methods of cultivating grapevines have been taken up by several notable vineyards  There are certification agencies for biodynamic products  most of which are members of the international biodynamics standards group Demeter International  No difference in beneficial outcomes has been scientifically established between certified biodynamic agricultural techniques and similar organic and integrated farming practices  Biodynamic agriculture lacks strong scientific evidence for its efficacy and has been labeled a is a pseudoscience because of its overreliance upon esoteric knowledge and mystical beliefs Blinded experimentA blind   or blinded   experiment is an experiment in which information about the test is masked  kept  from the participant  to reduce or eliminate bias  until after a trial outcome is known  It is understood that bias may be intentional or unconscious  thus no dishonesty is implied by blinding  If both tester and subject are blinded  the trial is called a double blind experiment  Blind testing is used wherever items are to be compared without influences from testers  preferences or expectations  for example in clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of medicinal drugs and procedures without placebo effect  observer bias  or conscious deception  and comparative testing of commercial products to objectively assess user preferences without being influenced by branding and other properties not being tested  Blinding can be imposed on researchers  technicians  or subjects  The opposite of a blind trial is an open trial  Blind experiments are an important tool of the scientific method  in many fields of research medicine  psychology and the social sciences  natural sciences such as physics and biology  applied sciences such as market research  and many others  In some disciplines  such as medicinal drug testing  blind experiments are considered essential  In some cases  while blind experiments would be useful  they are impractical or unethical  an example is in the field of developmental psychology  although it would be informative to raise children under arbitrary experimental conditions  such as on a remote island with a fabricated enculturation  it is a violation of ethics and human rights  The terms blind  adjective  or to blind  transitive verb  when used in this sense are figurative extensions of the literal idea of blindfolding someone  The terms masked or to mask may be used for the same concept  this is commonly the case in ophthalmology  where the word  blind  is often used in the literal sense  Some argue that the use of the term  blind  for academic review or experiments is offensive  Some recommend the alternate term  masked  or  anonymous  for this reason BloodlettingBloodletting  or blood letting  is the withdrawal of blood from a patient to cure or prevent illness and disease  Bloodletting was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluids were regarded as  humors  that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health  It is claimed to have been the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late   th century  a span of almost       years  In Europe the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the   th century  The practice has now been abandoned by modern style medicine for all except a few very specific conditions  It is conceivable that historically  in the absence of other treatments for hypertension  bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume  However  since hypertension is very often asymptomatic and thus undiagnosable without modern methods  this effect was unintentional  In the overwhelming majority of cases  the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients  Today  the term phlebotomy refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion  Therapeutic phlebotomy refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis  polycythemia vera  porphyria cutanea tarda  etc   to reduce the number of red blood cells  The traditional medical practice of bloodletting is today considered to be a pseudoscience Body memoryBody memory is a hypothesis that the body itself is capable of storing memories  as opposed to only the brain  The idea could be pseudoscientific as there are no known means by which tissues other than the brain are capable of storing memories  Body memory is used to explain having memories for events where the brain was not in a position to store memories and is sometimes a catalyst for repressed memory recovery  These memories are often characterised with phantom pain in a part or parts of the body   the body appearing to remember the past trauma  The idea of body memory is a belief frequently associated with the idea of repressed memories  in which memories of incest or sexual abuse can be retained and recovered through physical sensations  An example of body memory is based on decapitated animals that upon regrowing their head seem to recall past memories and training  This may suggest evidence that such means may be available to simpler forms of life   Bodywork  alternative medicine In alternative medicine  bodywork is any therapeutic or personal development technique that involves working with the human body in a form involving manipulative therapy  breath work  or energy medicine  Bodywork techniques also aim to assess or improve posture  promote awareness of the  bodymind connection  rather than the  mind body connection   or to manipulate a so called  energy field  surrounding the human body and affecting health BronzeBronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper  commonly with about     tin and often with the addition of other metals  such as aluminium  manganese  nickel or zinc  and sometimes non metals or metalloids such as arsenic  phosphorus or silicon  These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone  or have other useful properties  such as stiffness  ductility  or machinability  The archeological period where bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age  In the ancient Near East this began with the rise of Sumer in the  th millennium BC  with India and China starting to use bronze around the same time  everywhere it gradually spread across regions  The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about      BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about     BC  though bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times  Because historical pieces were often made of brasses  copper and zinc  and bronzes with different compositions  modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the more inclusive term  copper alloy  instead Bronze AgeThe Bronze Age is a historical period characterized by the use of bronze  proto writing  and other early features of urban civilization  The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three age Stone Bronze Iron system  as proposed in modern times by Christian J rgensen Thomsen  for classifying and studying ancient societies  An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin  arsenic  or other metals  or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere  Copper tin ores are rare  as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC  Worldwide  the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period  with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition  Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age  in some areas  such as Sub Saharan Africa   the Iron Age intruded directly on the Neolithic  Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing  According to archaeological evidence  cultures in Mesopotamia  cuneiform  and Egypt  hieroglyphs  developed the earliest viable writing systems Cutaneous conditionA cutaneous condition is any medical condition that affects the integumentary system the organ system that encloses the body and includes skin  hair  nails  and related muscle and glands  The major function of this system is as a barrier against the external environment  Conditions of the human integumentary system constitute a broad spectrum of diseases  also known as dermatoses  as well as many nonpathologic states  like  in certain circumstances  melanonychia and racquet nails   While only a small number of skin diseases account for most visits to the physician  thousands of skin conditions have been described  Classification of these conditions often presents many nosological challenges  since underlying etiologies and pathogenetics are often not known  Therefore  most current textbooks present a classification based on location  for example  conditions of the mucous membrane   morphology  chronic blistering conditions   etiology  skin conditions resulting from physical factors   and so on  Clinically  the diagnosis of any particular skin condition is made by gathering pertinent information regarding the presenting skin lesion s   including the location  such as arms  head  legs   symptoms  pruritus  pain   duration  acute or chronic   arrangement  solitary  generalized  annular  linear   morphology  macules  papules  vesicles   and color  red  blue  brown  black  white  yellow   The diagnosis of many conditions often also requires a skin biopsy which yields histologic information that can be correlated with the clinical presentation and any laboratory data Cancer related fatigueCancer related fatigue is a subjective symptom of fatigue that is experienced by nearly all cancer patients  Among patients receiving cancer treatment other than surgery  it is essentially universal  Fatigue is a normal and expected side effect of most forms of chemotherapy  radiation therapy  and biotherapy  On average  cancer related fatigue is  more severe  more distressing  and less likely to be relieved by rest  than fatigue experienced by healthy people  It can range from mild to severe  and may be either temporary or a long term effect  Fatigue may be a symptom of the cancer  or it may be the result of treatments for the cancer   Cancer painPain in cancer may arise from a tumor compressing or infiltrating nearby body parts  from treatments and diagnostic procedures  or from skin  nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response  Most chronic  long lasting  pain is caused by the illness and most acute  short term  pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures  However  radiotherapy  surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended  The presence of pain depends mainly on the location of the cancer and the stage of the disease  At any given time  about half of all patients with malignant cancer are experiencing pain  and two thirds of those with advanced cancer experience pain of such intensity that it adversely affects their sleep  mood  social relations and activities of daily living  With competent management  cancer pain can be eliminated or well controlled in    to    percent of cases  but nearly one in two patients in the developed world receives less than optimal care  Worldwide  nearly    percent of people with cancer receive little or no pain medication  Guidelines for the use of drugs in the management of cancer pain have been published by the World Health Organization  WHO  and others  Healthcare professionals have an ethical obligation to ensure that  whenever possible  the patient or patient s guardian is well informed about the risks and benefits associated with their pain management options  Adequate pain management may sometimes slightly shorten a dying patient s life Cardiac arrhythmiaCardiac arrhythmia  also known as cardiac dysrhythmia or irregular heartbeat  is a group of conditions in which the heartbeat is irregular  too fast  or too slow  A heart rate that is too fast   above     beats per minute in adults   is called tachycardia and a heart rate that is too slow   below    beats per minute   is called bradycardia  Many types of arrhythmia have no symptoms  When symptoms are present these may include palpitations or feeling a pause between heartbeats  More seriously there may be lightheadedness  passing out  shortness of breath  or chest pain  While most types of arrhythmia are not serious  some predispose a person to complications such as stroke or heart failure  Others may result in cardiac arrest  There are four main types of arrhythmia  extra beats  supraventricular tachycardias  ventricular arrhythmias  and bradyarrhythmias  Extra beats include premature atrial contractions  premature ventricular contractions  and premature junctional contractions  Supraventricular tachycardias include atrial fibrillation  atrial flutter  and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia  Ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia  Arrhythmias are due to problems with the electrical conduction system of the heart  Arrhythmias may occur in children  however  the normal range for the heart rate is different and depends on age  A number of tests can help with diagnosis including an electrocardiogram  ECG  and Holter monitor  Most arrhythmias can be effectively treated  Treatments may include medications  medical procedures such as a pacemaker  and surgery  Medications for a fast heart rate may include beta blockers or agents that attempt to restore a normal heart rhythm such as procainamide  This later group may have more significant side effects especially if taken for a long period of time  Pacemakers are often used for slow heart rates  Those with an irregular heartbeat are often treated with blood thinners to reduce the risk of complications  Those who have severe symptoms from an arrhythmia may receive urgent treatment with a jolt of electricity in the form of cardioversion or defibrillation  Arrhythmia affects millions of people  In Europe and North America  as of       atrial fibrillation affects about    to    of the population  Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter resulted in         deaths in       up from        in       Sudden cardiac death is the cause of about half of deaths due to cardiovascular disease or about     of all deaths globally  About     of sudden cardiac death is the result of ventricular arrhythmias  Arrhythmias may occur at any age but are more common among older people Myocardial ruptureMyocardial rupture is a laceration or tearing of the wall of the ventricles or atria of the heart  of the interatrial or interventricular septum  or of the papillary muscles  It is most commonly seen as a serious sequela of an acute myocardial infarction  heart attack   It can also be caused by trauma Cardiac tamponadeCardiac tamponade  also known as pericardial tamponade  is when fluid in the pericardium  the sac around the heart  builds up and results in compression of the heart  Onset may be rapid or more gradual  Symptoms typically include those of cardiogenic shock including shortness of breath  weakness  lightheadedness  and cough  Other symptoms may relate to the underlying cause  Common causes include cancer  kidney failure  chest trauma  and pericarditis  Other causes include connective tissue diseases  hypothyroidism  aortic rupture  and following cardiac surgery  In Africa  tuberculosis is a relatively common cause  Diagnosis may be suspected based on low blood pressure  jugular venous distension  pericardial rub  or quiet heart sounds  The diagnosis may be further supported by specific electrocardiogram  ECG  changes  chest X ray  or an ultrasound of the heart  If fluid increases slowly the pericardial sac can expand to contain more than   liters  however  if the increase is rapid as little as     mL can result in tamponade  When tamponade results in symptoms  drainage is necessary  This can be done by pericardiocentesis  surgery to create a pericardial window  or a pericardiectomy  Drainage may also be necessary to rule out infection or cancer  Other treatments may include the use of dobutamine or in those with low blood volume  intravenous fluids  Those with few symptoms and no worrisome features can often be closely followed  The frequency of tamponade is unclear  One estimate from the United States places it at   per        per year Cargo cult scienceCargo cult science comprises practices that have the semblance of being scientific  but do not in fact follow the scientific method  The term was first used by physicist Richard Feynman during his      commencement address at the California Institute of Technology  Cargo cults are religious practices that have appeared in many traditional tribal societies in the wake of interaction with technologically advanced cultures  They focus on obtaining the material wealth  the  cargo   of the advanced culture through magical means  by building landing strips  mock aircraft  mock radios  and the like Carpal tunnel syndromeCarpal tunnel syndrome  CTS  is a medical condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel  The main symptoms are pain  numbness  and tingling  in the thumb  index finger  middle finger  and the thumb side of the ring fingers  Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night  Pain may extend up the arm  Weak grip strength may occur and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away  In more than half of cases both sides are affected  Risk factors include obesity  repetitive wrist work  pregnancy  and rheumatoid arthritis  There is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk  It is unclear if diabetes plays a role  The use of birth control pills does not affect the risk  Types of work that are associated include computer work  work with vibrating tools  and work that requires a strong grip  Diagnosis is suspected based on signs  symptoms  and specific physical tests and may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic tests  If muscle wasting at the base of the thumb is present  the diagnosis is likely  Being physically active can decrease the risk of developing CTS  Symptoms can be improved by wearing a wrist splint or with corticosteroid injections  Taking NSAIDs or gabapentin does not appear to be useful  Surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is effective with better results at a year compared to non surgical options  Further splinting after surgery is not needed  Evidence does not support magnet therapy  About    of people in the United States have carpal tunnel syndrome  It usually begins in adulthood and women are more commonly affected than men  Up to     of people may improve without specific treatment over approximately a year  Carpal tunnel syndrome was first fully described after World War II CatastrophismCatastrophism is the theory that the Earth has been affected in the past by sudden  short lived  violent events  possibly worldwide in scope  This was in contrast to uniformitarianism  sometimes described as gradualism   in which slow incremental changes  such as erosion  created all the Earth s geological features  Uniformitarianism held that the present is the key to the past  and that all things continued as they were from the indefinite past  Since the early disputes  a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed  in which the scientific consensus accepts that there were some catastrophic events in the geologic past  but these were explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur  Catastrophism held that geological epochs had ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as great floods and the rapid formation of major mountain chains  Plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred were killed off  being replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata  Some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the Biblical account of Noah s flood  The concept was first popularised by the early   th century French scientist Georges Cuvier  who proposed that new life forms had moved in from other areas after local floods  and avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings CausalityCausality  also referred to as causation  or cause and effect  is the agency or efficacy that connects one process  the cause  with another process or state  the effect   where the first is understood to be partly responsible for the second  and the second is dependent on the first  In general  a process has many causes  which are said to be causal factors for it  and all lie in its past  An effect can in turn be a cause of many other effects  Although retrocausality is sometimes referred to in thought experiments and hypothetical analyses  causality is generally accepted to be temporally bound so that causes always precede their dependent effects  although in some contexts such as economics they may coincide in time  see Instrumental variable for how this is dealt with econometrically   Causality is an abstraction that indicates how the world progresses  so basic a concept that it is more apt as an explanation of other concepts of progression than as something to be explained by others more basic  The concept is like those of agency and efficacy  For this reason  a leap of intuition may be needed to grasp it  Accordingly  causality is built into the conceptual structure of ordinary language  In Aristotelian philosophy  the word  cause  is also used to mean  explanation  or  answer to a why question   including Aristotle s material  formal  efficient  and final  causes   then the  cause  is the explanans for the explanandum  In this case  failure to recognize that different kinds of  cause  are being considered can lead to futile debate  Of Aristotle s four explanatory modes  the one nearest to the concerns of the present article is the  efficient  one  The topic remains a staple in contemporary philosophy  While studying of meaning of causality semantics traditionally appeal to the chicken or the egg causality dilemma  i e   which came first  the chicken or the egg    Then it allocates its constituent elements  a cause  an effect and link itself  that joins both of them CauterizationCauterization  or cauterisation  or cautery  is a medical practice or technique of burning a part of a body to remove or close off a part of it  It destroys some tissue in an attempt to mitigate bleeding and damage  remove an undesired growth  or minimize other potential medical harm  such as infections when antibiotics are unavailable  The practice was once widespread for treatment of wounds  Its utility before the advent of antibiotics was said to be effective at more than one level  To stop severe blood loss and to prevent exsanguination To close amputations Cautery was historically believed to prevent infection  but current research shows that cautery actually increases the risk for infection by causing more tissue damage and providing a more hospitable environment for bacterial growth  Actual cautery refers to the metal device  generally heated to a dull red glow  that a physician applies to produce blisters  to stop bleeding of a blood vessel  and for other similar purposes  The main forms of cauterization used today in the first world are electrocautery and chemical cautery both are  for example  prevalent in the removal of unsightly warts  Cautery can also mean the branding of a human  either recreational or forced Central nervous systemThe central nervous system  CNS  is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord  The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from  and coordinates and influences the activity of all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals that is  all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish and it contains the majority of the nervous system  Many consider the retina and the optic nerve   nd cranial nerve   as well as the olfactory nerves   st  and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS  synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia  Following this classification the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment  which opens up for therapeutic treatments   The CNS is contained within the dorsal body cavity  with the brain housed in the cranial cavity and the spinal cord in the spinal canal  In vertebrates  the brain is protected by the skull  while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae  both  brain and spinal cord  enclosed in the meninges Intracerebral hemorrhageIntracerebral hemorrhage  ICH   also known as cerebral bleed  is a type of intracranial bleed that occurs within the brain tissue or ventricles  Symptoms can include headache  one sided weakness  vomiting  seizures  decreased level of consciousness  and neck stiffness  Often symptoms get worse over time  Fever is also common  In many cases bleeding is present in both the brain tissue and the ventricles  Causes include brain trauma  aneurysms  arteriovenous malformations  and brain tumors  The largest risk factors for spontaneous bleeding are high blood pressure and amyloidosis  Other risk factors include alcoholism  low cholesterol  blood thinners  and cocaine  Diagnosis is typically by CT scan  Other conditions that may present similarly include ischemic stroke  Treatment should typically be carried out in an intensive care unit  Guidelines recommended decreasing the blood pressure to a systolic of less than     mmHg  Blood thinners should be reversed if possible and blood sugar kept in the normal range  Surgery to place a ventricular drain may be used to treat hydrocephalus but corticosteroids should not be used  Surgery to remove the blood is useful in certain cases  Cerebral bleeding affects about     per        people each year  It occurs more often in males and older people  About     of those affected die within a month  A good outcome occurs in about     of those affected  Strokes were first divided into their two major types  bleeding and insufficient blood flow  in      CharlatanA charlatan  also called swindler or mountebank  is a person practising quackery or some similar confidence trick in order to obtain money  fame or other advantages via some form of pretense or deception  The word comes from French charlatan  a seller of medicines who might advertise his presence with music and an outdoor stage show  The best known of the Parisian charlatans was Tabarin  who set up a stage in the Place Dauphine  Paris in       and whose commedia dell arte inspired skits and farces inspired Moli re  The word can also be traced to Spanish  charlat n  an indiscreetly talkative person  a chatterbox  Ultimately  etymologists trace  charlatan  from either the Italian ciarlare  to chatter or prattle  or from Cerretano  a resident of Cerreto  a village in Umbria  known for its quacks Chemotherapy induced nausea and vomitingChemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  CINV  is a common side effect of many cancer treatments  Nausea and vomiting are two of the most feared cancer treatment related side effects for cancer patients and their families  In       Coates et al  found that patients receiving chemotherapy ranked nausea and vomiting as the first and second most severe side effects  respectively  Up to     of patients receiving highly emetogenic agents in this era postponed  or even refused  potentially curative treatments  Since the     s  several novel classes of antiemetics have been developed and commercialized  becoming a nearly universal standard in chemotherapy regimens  and helping to better manage these symptoms in a large portion of patients  Efficient mediation of these unpleasant and sometimes crippling symptoms results in increased quality of life for the patient  and better overall health of the patient  and  due to better patient tolerance  more effective treatment cycles Chemtrail conspiracy theoryThe chemtrail conspiracy theory is the unproven belief that long lasting trails  so called  chemtrails   are left in the sky by high flying aircraft and that they consist of chemical or biological agents deliberately sprayed for sinister purposes undisclosed to the general public  Believers in the theory argue that normal contrails dissipate relatively quickly and that contrails that do not dissipate must contain additional substances  These arguments have been dismissed by the scientific community  such trails are normal water based contrails  condensation trails  that are routinely left by high flying aircraft under certain atmospheric conditions  Although proponents have attempted to prove that the claimed chemical spraying does take place  their analyses have been flawed or based on misconceptions  Because of the persistence of the conspiracy theory and questions about government involvement  scientists and government agencies around the world have repeatedly explained that supposed chemtrails are in fact normal contrails  The term chemtrail is a portmanteau of the words chemical and trail  as contrail is of condensation and trail  Believers in the conspiracy theory speculate that the purpose of the claimed chemical release may be solar radiation management  psychological manipulation  human population control  weather modification  or biological or chemical warfare and that the trails are causing respiratory illnesses and other health problems Chinese herbologyChinese herbology  simplified Chinese       traditional Chinese       pinyin  zh ngy o xu   is the theory of traditional Chinese herbal therapy  which accounts for the majority of treatments in traditional Chinese medicine  TCM   A Nature editorial described TCM as  fraught with pseudoscience   and said that the most obvious reason why it has not delivered many cures is that the majority of its treatments have no logical mechanism of action  The term herbology is misleading in the sense that  while plant elements are by far the most commonly used substances  animal  human  and mineral products are also utilized  In the Neijing they are referred to as     duyao  which means toxin  poison  or medicine  Unschuld

concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of unverified mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system  especially the spine  Proponents believe that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system  The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy  especially spinal manipulation therapy  SMT   manipulations of other joints and soft tissues  Its foundation is at odds with mainstream medicine  and chiropractic is sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation and  innate intelligence   Multiple systematic reviews have found no evidence that chiropractic manipulation is effective  with the possible exception of treatment for lower back pain  A critical evaluation found that collectively  spinal manipulation was ineffective at treating any condition  There is not sufficient data to establish the safety of chiropractic manipulations  The rate of adverse events is unknown as they are under reported  Chiropractic is frequently associated with mild to moderate adverse effects  The incidence of serious complications which can lead to permanent disability or death is probably rare  There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of stroke and death from cervical manipulation  Several deaths have been associated with this technique and it is suggested that the relationship is causative  a claim which is disputed by many chiropractors  Chiropractic is widely established in the United States  Canada  and Australia  It has had a strong political base and sustained demand for services  in recent decades gaining increased acceptance among conventional physicians and health plans in the U S   and evidence based medicine has been used to review research studies and generate practice guidelines  Most who seek chiropractic care do so for low back pain  and back and neck pain are considered the specialties of chiropractic  but many chiropractors treat ailments other than musculoskeletal issues  Many chiropractors describe themselves as primary care providers  despite chiropractic clinical training not supporting the requirements to perform such care  with their role in primary care being limited and disputed  Attitudes towards mainstream medicine vary among chiropractors  who often offer conventional treatments such as physical therapy and lifestyle counseling as well  and it may be difficult for the lay person to distinguish the unscientific from the scientific  D  D  Palmer founded chiropractic in the     s  after allegedly receiving it from  the other world   and his son B  J  Palmer helped to expand it in the early   th century  Throughout its history  chiropractic has been controversial ChromotherapyChromotherapy  sometimes called color therapy  colorology or cromatherapy  is an alternative medicine method  which is considered pseudoscience  Chromotherapists claim to be able to use light in the form of color to balance  energy  lacking from a person s body  whether it be on physical  emotional  spiritual  or mental levels  Research has shown it is ineffective  Color therapy is distinct from other types of light therapy  such as neonatal jaundice treatment and blood irradiation therapy which is a scientifically accepted medical treatment for a number of conditions  and from photobiology  the scientific study of the effects of light on living organisms Chronic conditionA chronic condition is a human health condition or disease that is persistent or otherwise long lasting in its effects or a disease that comes with time  The term chronic is often applied when the course of the disease lasts for more than three months  Common chronic diseases include arthritis  asthma  cancer  COPD  diabetes and viral diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV AIDS  In medicine  the opposite of chronic is acute  A chronic course is further distinguished from a recurrent course  recurrent diseases relapse repeatedly  with periods of remission in between  The non communicable diseases are also usually lasting medical conditions but are separated by their non infectious causes  In contrast  some chronic diseases  such as HIV AIDS  are caused by transmissible infections  In the United States     of adults have at least two chronic conditions  Chronic diseases constitute a major cause of mortality  with the World Health Organization  WHO  attributing    million deaths a year to non communicable diseases Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseChronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD  is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long term poor airflow  The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production  COPD is a progressive disease  meaning it typically worsens over time  Eventually everyday activities  such as walking up stairs  become difficult  Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD  The term  chronic bronchitis  is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years  Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD  with factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role  In the developing world  one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires  Long term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs  resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue  The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests  In contrast to asthma  the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator  Most cases of COPD can be prevented by reducing exposure to risk factors  This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality  While treatment can slow worsening  there is no cure  COPD treatments include stopping smoking  vaccinations  respiratory rehabilitation  and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids  Some people may benefit from long term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation  In those who have periods of acute worsening  increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed  As of      COPD affects     million people or nearly   percent of the global population  It typically occurs in people over the age of     Males and females are affected equally commonly  In      it resulted in     million deaths  up from     million deaths in       More than     of these deaths occur in the developing world  The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of higher smoking rates in the developing world  and an aging population in many countries  It resulted in an estimated economic cost of      trillion in      Chronic painChronic pain is pain that lasts a long time  In medicine  the distinction between acute and chronic pain is sometimes determined by an arbitrary interval of time since onset  the two most commonly used markers being   months and   months since onset  though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at    months  Others apply acute to pain that lasts less than    days  chronic to pain of more than six months duration  and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months  A popular alternative definition of chronic pain  involving no arbitrarily fixed duration  is  pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing   Epidemiological studies have found that       to       of people in various countries have chronic pain  Chronic pain may originate in the body  or in the brain or spinal cord  It is difficult to treat  and is often handled by a pain management team  Some people with chronic pain benefit from opioid treatment and others do not  some are harmed by the treatment  Various nonopioid medicines are also used  depending on whether the pain originates from tissue damage or is neuropathic  Psychological treatments including cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy have been shown effective for improving quality of life in those with chronic pain  Severe chronic pain is associated with increased    year mortality  particularly from heart disease and respiratory disease  People with chronic pain tend to have higher rates of depression  anxiety  sleep disturbances  and neuroticism  these are correlations and it is often not clear which factor causes another  Chronic pain may contribute to decreased physical activity due to fear of exacerbating pain  often resulting in weight gain  Pain intensity  pain control  and resiliency to pain are influenced by different levels and types of social support that a person with chronic pain receives Churchill LivingstoneChurchill Livingstone is an academic publisher  It is an imprint of

previously known as the Cochrane Collaboration  is an independent  non profit  non governmental organization consisting of a group of more than        volunteers in more than     countries  The group was formed to organize medical research information in a systematic way to facilitate the choices that health professionals  patients  policy makers and others face in health interventions according to the principles of evidence based medicine  The group conducts systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of health care interventions and diagnostic tests  which it publishes in The Cochrane Library  A few reviews  in fields such as occupational health  have also studied the results of non randomized  observational studies Cochrane LibraryThe Cochrane Library  named after Archie Cochrane  is a collection of databases in medicine and other healthcare specialties provided by Cochrane and other organizations  At its core is the collection of Cochrane Reviews  a database of systematic reviews and meta analyses which summarize and interpret the results of medical research  The Cochrane Library aims to make the results of well conducted controlled trials readily available and is a key resource in evidence based medicine Colon cleansingColon cleansing  also known as colon therapy  encompasses a number of alternative medical therapies claimed to remove nonspecific toxins from the colon and intestinal tract  Colon cleansing may be branded colon hydrotherapy  a colonic or colonic irrigation  During the     s internet marketing and infomercials of oral supplements supposedly for colon cleansing increased  Some forms of colon hydrotherapy use tubes to inject water  sometimes mixed with herbs or with other liquids  into the colon via the rectum using special equipment  Oral cleaning regimens use dietary fiber  herbs  dietary supplements  or laxatives  People who practice colon cleansing believe that accumulations of putrefied feces line the walls of the large intestine and that these accumulations harbor parasites or pathogenic gut flora  causing nonspecific symptoms and general ill health  This  auto intoxication  hypothesis is based on medical beliefs of the Ancient Egyptians and Greeks and was discredited in the early   th century  No scientific evidence supports the alleged benefits of colon cleansing  Certain enema preparations have been associated with heart attacks and electrolyte imbalances  and improperly prepared or used equipment can cause infection or damage to the bowel  Frequent colon cleansing can lead to dependence on enemas to defecate and some herbs may reduce the effectiveness of or increase the risks associated with the use of prescription drugs ColorpunctureColorpuncture  or color light acupuncture  is an alternative medicine practice asserting that colored lights can be used to stimulate acupuncture points to promote healing and better health  It is a form of chromotherapy or color therapy  There is no known anatomical or histological basis for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians  Colorpuncture is in the early stages of scientific research Committee for Skeptical InquiryThe Committee for Skeptical Inquiry  CSI   formerly known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal  CSICOP   is a program within the transnational American non profit educational organization Center for Inquiry  CFI   which seeks to  promote scientific inquiry  critical investigation  and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims   It was founded by Paul Kurtz in      as an independent non profit organization  before merging with CFI as one of its programs in        to counter what he regarded as an uncritical acceptance of  and support for  paranormal claims by both the media and society in general  Its philosophical position is one of scientific skepticism  CSI s fellows have included notable scientists  Nobel laureates  philosophers  psychologists  educators and authors  It is headquartered in Amherst  New York Communist Party of ChinaThe Communist Party of China  CPC  is the founding and ruling political party of the People s Republic of China  PRC   The CPC is the sole governing party of China  although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front  these parties  however  hold no real power or independence from the CPC  It was founded in       chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao  The party grew quickly  and by      the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang  KMT  government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War  thus leading to the establishment of the People s Republic of China  The CPC is currently the world s second largest political party with a membership of       million as of       while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have remained the largest with a membership of     million as of the previous year         It also controls the world s largest armed force  the People s Liberation Army  The CPC is  officially  organized on the basis of democratic centralism  a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies  The highest body of the CPC is the National Congress  convened every fifth year  When the National Congress is not in session  the Central Committee is the highest body  but since the body meets normally only once a year  most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee  The party s leader holds the offices of General Secretary  responsible for civilian party duties   Chairman of the Central Military Commission  CMC   responsible for military affairs  and State President  a largely ceremonial position   Through these posts the party leader is the country s paramount leader  The current party leader is Xi Jinping  elected at the   th National Congress  held in        The CPC is still committed to communist thought and continues to participate in the International Meeting of Communist and Workers  Parties each year  According to the party constitution the CPC adheres to Marxism Leninism  Mao Zedong Thought  socialism with Chinese characteristics  Deng Xiaoping Theory  Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development  The official explanation for China s economic reforms is that the country is in the primary stage of socialism  a developmental stage similar to the capitalist mode of production  The planned economy established under Mao Zedong was replaced by the socialist market economy  the current economic system  on the basis that  Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth   i e  the planned economy was deemed inefficient   Since the collapse of Eastern European communist regimes in           and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in       the CPC has emphasized its party to party relations with the ruling parties of the remaining socialist states  While the CPC still maintains party to party relations with non ruling communist parties around the world  since the     s it has established relations with several non communist parties  most notably with ruling parties of one party states  whatever their ideology   dominant parties in democratic systems  whatever their ideology   and social democratic parties Conspiracy theoryA conspiracy theory is an explanation of an event or situation that invokes a conspiracy without warrant  generally one involving an illegal or harmful act carried out by government or other powerful actors  Conspiracy theories often produce hypotheses that contradict the prevailing understanding of history or simple facts  The term is a derogatory one  According to the political scientist Michael Barkun  conspiracy theories rely on the view that the universe is governed by design  and embody three principles  nothing happens by accident  nothing is as it seems  and everything is connected  Another common feature is that conspiracy theories evolve to incorporate whatever evidence exists against them  so that they become  as Barkun writes  a closed system that is unfalsifiable  and therefore  a matter of faith rather than proof  ConstipationConstipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass  The stool is often hard and dry  Other symptoms may include abdominal pain  bloating  and feeling as if they have not completely pass the bowel movement  Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids  anal fissure or fecal impaction  The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week  Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day  Constipation has many causes  Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon  irritable bowel syndrome  and pelvic disorders  Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism  diabetes  Parkinson s disease  colon cancer  diverticulitis  and inflammatory bowel disease  Medications associated with constipation include opioids  certain antacids  calcium channel blockers  and anticholinergics  Of those taking opioids about     develop constipation  Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia  blood is present in the stool  there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person s family  or it is of new onset in someone who is older  Treatment of constipation depends on the underlying cause and the duration that it has been present  Measures that may help include drinking enough fluids  eating more fiber  and exercise  If this is not effective laxatives of the bulk forming agent  osmotic agent  stool softener  or lubricant type may be recommended  Stimulant laxatives are generally reserved for when other types are not effective  Other treatments may include biofeedback or surgery  In the general population rates of constipation are      percent  Among old people living in a care home the rate of constipation is       percent  People spend  in the United States  more than US     million on medications for constipation a year ContraindicationIn medicine  a contraindication is a condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment due to the harm that it would cause the patient  Contraindication is the opposite of indication  which is a reason to use a certain treatment  Some contraindications are absolute  meaning that there are no reasonable circumstances for undertaking a course of action  For example  children and teenagers with viral infections should not be given aspirin because of the risk of Reye s syndrome  and a person with an anaphylactic food allergy should never eat the food to which they are allergic  Similarly  a person with hemochromatosis should not be administered iron preparations  Other contraindications are relative  meaning that the patient is at higher risk of complications  but these risks may be outweighed by other considerations or mitigated by other measures  For example  a pregnant woman should normally avoid getting X rays  but the risk may be outweighed by the benefit of diagnosing  and then treating  a serious condition such as tuberculosis  Relative contraindications may also be referred to as cautions  such as in the British National Formulary Treatment and control groupsIn the design of experiments  treatments are applied to experimental units in the treatment group s   In comparative experiments  members of the complementary group  the control group  receive either no treatment or a standard treatment  For the conclusions drawn from the results of an experiment to have validity  it is essential that the items or patients assigned to treatment and control groups be representative of the same population  In some experiments  such as many in agriculture or psychology  this can be achieved by randomly assigning items from a common population to one of the treatment and control groups  In studies of twins involving just one treatment group and a control group  it is statistically efficient to do this random assignment separately for each pair of twins  so that one is in the treatment group and one in the control group  In some medical studies  where it may be unethical not to treat patients who present with symptoms  controls may be given a standard treatment  rather than no treatment at all  Another alternative is to select controls from a wider population  provided that this population is well defined and that those presenting with symptoms at the clinic are representative of those in the wider population Conversion therapyConversion therapy is psychological treatment or spiritual counseling designed to change a person s sexual orientation from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual  Such treatments are controversial  and are a form of pseudoscience  Medical  scientific  and government organizations in the United States and Britain have expressed concern over conversion therapy and consider it potentially harmful  The American Psychiatric Association opposes psychiatric treatment  based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his her sexual homosexual orientation  and describes attempts to change sexual orientation by practitioners as unethical  It also states that debates over the integration of gay and lesbian people have obscured science  by calling into question the motives and even the character of individuals on both sides of the issue  and that the advancement of conversion therapy may cause social harm by disseminating unscientific views about sexual orientation  United States Surgeon General David Satcher in      issued a report stating that  there is no valid scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed   The highest profile advocates of conversion therapy today tend to be fundamentalist Christian groups and other organizations which use a religious justification for the therapy rather than speaking of homosexuality as  a disease   The main organization advocating secular forms of conversion therapy is the National Association for Research   Therapy of Homosexuality  NARTH   which often partners with religious groups  Techniques used in conversion therapy prior to      in the United States and Western Europe included ice pick lobotomies  chemical castration with hormonal treatment  aversive treatments  such as  the application of electric shock to the hands and or genitals    nausea inducing drugs     administered simultaneously with the presentation of homoerotic stimuli   and masturbatory reconditioning  More recent clinical techniques used in the United States have been limited to counseling  visualization  social skills training  psychoanalytic therapy  and spiritual interventions such as  prayer and group support and pressure   though there are some reports of aversive treatments through unlicensed practice as late as the     s  The term reparative therapy has been used as a synonym for conversion therapy in general  but it has been argued that strictly speaking it refers to a specific kind of therapy associated with Elizabeth Moberly and Joseph Nicolosi Cost effectiveness analysisCost effectiveness analysis  CEA  is a form of economic analysis that compares the relative costs and outcomes  effects  of different courses of action  Cost effectiveness analysis is distinct from cost benefit analysis  which assigns a monetary value to the measure of effect  Cost effectiveness analysis is often used in the field of health services  where it may be inappropriate to monetize health effect  Typically the CEA is expressed in terms of a ratio where the denominator is a gain in health from a measure  years of life  premature births averted  sight years gained  and the numerator is the cost associated with the health gain  The most commonly used outcome measure is quality adjusted life years  QALY   Cost utility analysis is similar to cost effectiveness analysis  Cost effectiveness analyses are often visualized on a plane consisting of four quadrants  the cost represented on the x axis and the effectiveness on the y  axis  Cost effectiveness analysis focuses on maximising the average level of an outcome  distributional cost effectiveness analysis extends the core methods of CEA to incorporate concerns for the distribution of outcomes as well as their average level and make trade offs between equity and efficiency  these more sophisticated methods are of particular interest when analysing interventions to tackle health inequality Crank  person  Crank  is a pejorative term used for a person who holds an unshakable belief that most of his or her contemporaries consider to be false  A crank belief is so wildly at variance with those commonly held as to be considered ludicrous  Cranks characteristically dismiss all evidence or arguments which contradict their own unconventional beliefs  making any rational debate a futile task and rendering them impervious to facts  evidence  and rational inference  Common synonyms for  crank  include crackpot and kook  A crank differs from a fanatic in that the subject of the fanatic s obsession is either not necessarily widely regarded as wrong or not necessarily a  fringe  belief  Similarly  the word quack is reserved for someone who promotes a medical remedy or practice that is widely considered to be ineffective  this term  however  does not imply any deep belief in the idea or product they are attempting to sell  Crank may also refer to an ill tempered individual or one who is in a bad mood  but that usage is not the subject of this article  Although experts in the field find a crank s beliefs ridiculous  cranks are sometimes very successful in convincing non experts of their views  A famous example is the Indiana Pi Bill where a state legislature nearly wrote into law a crank result in geometry Creation scienceCreation science or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism that claims to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and disprove or reexplain the scientific facts  theories and scientific paradigms about geology  cosmology  biological evolution  archeology  history  and linguistics  The overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is that creation science is a religious  not a scientific view  It fails to qualify as a science because it lacks empirical support  supplies no tentative hypotheses  and resolves to describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes  Creation science is a pseudoscientific attempt to map the Bible into scientific facts  It is viewed by professional scientists as unscholarly  and even as a dishonest and misguided sham  with extremely harmful educational consequences  Creation science began in the     s  as a fundamentalist Christian effort in the United States to prove Biblical inerrancy and nullify the scientific evidence for evolution  It has since developed a sizable religious following in the United States  with creation science ministries branching worldwide  The main ideas in creation science are  the belief in  creation ex nihilo   Latin  out of nothing   the conviction that the Earth was created within the last              years  the belief that mankind and other life on Earth were created as distinct fixed  baraminological  kinds  and the idea that fossils found in geological strata were deposited during a cataclysmic flood which completely covered the entire Earth  As a result  creation science also challenges the commonly accepted geologic and astrophysical theories for the age and origins of the Earth and Universe  which creationists acknowledge are irreconcilable to the account in the Book of Genesis  Creation science proponents often refer to the theory of evolution as  Darwinism  or as  Darwinian evolution   The creation science texts and curricula that first emerged in the     s focused upon concepts derived from a literal interpretation of the Bible and were overtly religious in nature  most notably linking Noah s flood in the Biblical Genesis account to the geological and fossil record in a system termed flood geology  These works attracted little notice beyond the schools and congregations of conservative fundamental and Evangelical Christians until the     s when its followers challenged the teaching of evolution in the public schools and other venues in the United States  bringing it to the attention of the public at large and the scientific community  Many school boards and lawmakers were persuaded to include the teaching of creation science alongside evolution in the science curriculum  Creation science texts and curricula used in churches and Christian schools were revised to eliminate their Biblical and theological references  and less explicitly sectarian versions of creation science education were introduced in public schools in Louisiana  Arkansas  and other regions in the United States  The      ruling in McLean v  Arkansas found that creation science fails to meet the essential characteristics of science and that its chief intent is to advance a particular religious view  The teaching of creation science in public schools in the United States effectively ended in      following the United States Supreme Court decision in Edwards v  Aguillard  The court affirmed that a statute requiring the teaching of creation science alongside evolution when evolution is taught in Louisiana public schools was unconstitutional because its sole true purpose was to advance a particular religious belief  In response to this ruling  drafts of the creation science school textbook Of Pandas and People were edited to change references of creation to intelligent design before its publication in       The intelligent design movement promoted this version  then teaching intelligent design in public school science classes was found to be unconstitutional in the      Kitzmiller v  Dover Area School District federal court case Critical Reviews in Eukaryotic Gene ExpressionCritical Reviews in Eukaryotic Gene Expression  ISSN            is a quarterly scientific journal published by Begell House publishing reviews

record  such as Bigfoot or chupacabras  as well as undetected animals otherwise considered extinct  such as dinosaurs  Cryptozoologists refer to these entites as cryptids  Because it does not follow the scientific method  cryptozoology is considered a pseudoscience by the academic world  it is neither a branch of zoology nor folkloristics Crystal healingCrystal healing is a pseudoscientific alternative medicine technique that employs stones and crystals  Adherents of the technique claim that these have healing powers  although there is no scientific basis for this claim  In one method  the practitioner places crystals on different parts of the body  often corresponding to chakras  or else the practitioner places crystals around the body in an attempt to construct an energy grid  which is purported to surround the client with healing energy  Despite this  scientific investigations have not validated claims that chakras or energy grids actually exist  nor is there any evidence that crystal healing has any greater effect upon the body than any other placebo so it is generally considered to be pseudoscience Cults of UnreasonCults of Unreason is a non fiction book on atypical belief systems  written by Christopher Riche Evans  Ph D   who was a noted computer scientist and an experimental psychologist  It was first published in the UK in      by Harrap and in the United States in      by Farrar  Straus and Giroux  in paperback in       by Delacorte Press  and in German  by Rowohlt  in       Evans discusses Scientology and Dianetics  UFO religions  believers in Atlantis  biofeedback  Yoga  Eastern religions  and black boxes  He points out that these systems and groups incorporate technological advances within a theological framework  and that part of their appeal is due to the failure of modern people to find strength  comfort  and community in traditional religion and in science  In      new religious movement specialist George Chryssides criticized the book s title by pointing out that most groups referred to as cults do have well defined beliefs Cupping therapyCupping therapy is a form of alternative medicine in which a local suction is created on the skin  Cupping has been characterized as pseudoscience  There is no good evidence it has any benefit on health and there are some concerns it may be harmful  Through suction  the skin is drawn into the cup by creating a vacuum in the cup placed on the skin over the targeted area  The vacuum can be created either by the heating and subsequent cooling of the air in the cup  or via a mechanical pump  The cup is usually left in place for somewhere between five and fifteen minutes  It is believed by some to help treat pain  deep scar tissues in the muscles and connective tissue

Science Based Medicine DeathDeath is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism  Phenomena which commonly bring about death include biological aging  senescence   predation  malnutrition  disease  suicide  homicide  starvation  dehydration  and accidents or trauma resulting in terminal injury  Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death  Death   particularly the death of humans   has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion  due to the affection for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial bonds with the deceased  Other concerns include fear of death  necrophobia  anxiety  sorrow  grief  emotional pain  depression  sympathy  compassion  solitude  or saudade  The potential for an afterlife is of concern for some humans and the possibility of reward or judgement and punishment for past sin with people of certain religions Default mode networkIn neuroscience  the default mode network  DMN    also default network  or default state network   is a network of interacting brain regions known to have activity highly correlated with each other and distinct from other networks in the brain  The default mode network is most commonly shown to be active when a person is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest  such as during daydreaming and mind wandering  But it is also active when the individual is thinking about others  thinking about themselves  remembering the past  and planning for the future  The network activates  by default  when a person is not involved in a task  Though the DMN was originally noticed to be deactivated in certain goal oriented tasks and is sometimes referred to as the task negative network  it can be active in other goal oriented tasks such as social working memory or autobiographical tasks  The DMN has been shown to be negatively correlated with other networks in the brain such as attention networks  Thinking about others also could include guessing their thoughts  emotions  and psychological motivations  Evidence has pointed to disruptions in the DMN with people with Alzheimer s and autism spectrum disorder Dental amalgam controversyThis discussion of the dental amalgam controversy outlines the debate over whether dental amalgam  the  silver  in dental fillings  should be used  Supporters claim that it is safe  effective and long lasting while critics argue that claims have been made since the     s that amalgam is unsafe because it may cause mercury poisoning and other toxicity  Those who are not opposed to the use of amalgam point out that it is safe  durable  relatively inexpensive  and easy to use  On average  amalgam lasts twice as long as resin composites  takes less time to place  is tolerant of saliva or blood contamination during placement  unlike composites   and is often about        less expensive  Consumer Reports has suggested that many who claim dental amalgam is not safe are  prospecting for disease  and using pseudoscience to scare patients into more lucrative treatment options  Those opposed to amalgam use suggest that modern composites are improving in strength  In addition to their claims of possible health and ethical issues  opponents of dental amalgam fillings claim amalgam fillings contribute to mercury contamination of the environment  The World Health Organization  WHO  reports that health care facilities  including dental offices  account for as much as    of total waste water mercury emissions  The WHO also points out that amalgam separators  installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices  dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system  However  critics say that the separators are not mandatory in some states of the United States  The critics also point to cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution  contributing about    of total global emissions  It is the position of the FDI World Dental Federation as well as numerous dental associations and dental public health agencies worldwide that amalgam restorations are safe and effective  In addition  numerous other organizations have publicly declared the safety and effectiveness of amalgam and warned the public against those who suggest otherwise  These include the Mayo clinic  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   Health Canada  Alzheimer s Association  American Academy of Pediatrics  Autism Society of America  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  National Multiple Sclerosis Society  New England Journal of Medicine  International Journal of Dentistry  National Council Against Health Fraud  The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research NIDCR  American Cancer Society  Lupus Foundation of America  the American College of Medical Toxicology  the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology  Consumer Reports Prevention Magazine  and WebMD Dermatome  anatomy A dermatome is an area of skin that is mainly supplied by a single spinal nerve  There are   cervical nerves  C  being an exception with no dermatome      thoracic nerves    lumbar nerves and   sacral nerves  Each of these nerves relays sensation  including pain  from a particular region of skin to the brain  A dermatome also refers to the part of an embryonic somite  Along the thorax and abdomen the dermatomes are like a stack of discs forming a human  each supplied by a different spinal nerve  Along the arms and the legs  the pattern is different  the dermatomes run longitudinally along the limbs  Although the general pattern is similar in all people  the precise areas of innervation are as unique to an individual as fingerprints  A similar area innervated by peripheral nerves is called a peripheral nerve field Detoxification  alternative medicine Detoxification  sometimes called body cleansing  is a type of alternative medicine treatment which aims to rid the body of unspecified  toxins    accumulated substances that proponents claim have undesirable short term or long term effects on individual health  Activities commonly associated with detoxification include dieting  fasting  consuming exclusively or avoiding specific foods  such as fats  carbohydrates  fruits  vegetables  juices  herbs  or water   colon cleansing  chelation therapy  and the removal of dental fillings  The concept has received criticism from scientists and health organizations for its unsound scientific basis and lack of evidence for the claims they make  The  toxins  usually remain undefined  with little to no evidence of toxic accumulation in the patient  The British organisation Sense About Science has described some detox diets and commercial products as  a waste of time and money   while the British Dietetic Association called the idea  nonsense  and a  marketing myth  DianeticsDianetics  from Greek dia  meaning  through   and nous  meaning  mind   is a set of ideas and practices regarding the metaphysical relationship between the mind and body created by L  Ron Hubbard  Dianetics is practiced by followers of Scientology and independent Dianeticist groups  Dianetics has achieved no acceptance as a scientific theory and is widely considered to be a pseudoscience  Dianetics divides the mind into three parts  the conscious  analytical mind   the subconscious  reactive mind   and the somatic mind  The goal of Dianetics is to erase the content of the  reactive mind   which Scientologists believe interferes with a person s ethics  awareness  happiness  and sanity  The Dianetics procedure to achieve this erasure is called  auditing   In auditing  the Dianetic auditor asks a series of questions  or commands  and elicits answers to help a person locate and deal with painful experiences of the past  which Scientologists believe to be the content of the  reactive mind   Practitioners of Dianetics believe that  the basic principle of existence is to survive  and that the basic personality of humans is sincere  intelligent  and good  The drive for goodness and survival is distorted and inhibited by aberrations  ranging from simple neuroses to different psychotic states to various kinds of sociopathic behavior patterns   Hubbard developed Dianetics  claiming that it could eradicate these aberrations  When Hubbard formulated Dianetics  he described it as  a mix of Western technology and Oriental philosophy   He said that Dianetics  forms a bridge between  cybernetics and general semantics  a set of ideas about education originated by Alfred Korzybski  which received much attention in the science fiction world in the     s  a claim denied by scholars of General Semantics  including S  I  Hayakawa  who expressed strong criticism of Dianetics as early as       Hubbard claimed that Dianetics could increase intelligence  eliminate unwanted emotions and alleviate a wide range of illnesses he believed to be psychosomatic  Among the conditions purportedly treated were arthritis  allergies  asthma  some coronary difficulties  eye trouble  ulcers  migraine headaches   sexual deviation   which for Hubbard included homosexuality   and even death  Hubbard asserted that  memories of painful physical and emotional experiences accumulate in a specific region of the mind  causing illness and mental problems   He taught that  once these experiences have been purged through cathartic procedures he developed  a person can achieve superior health and intelligence   Hubbard also variously defined Dianetics as  a spiritual healing technology  and  an organized science of thought   Dianetics predates Hubbard s classification of Scientology as an  applied religious philosophy   Early in       he expanded his writings to include teachings related to the soul  or  thetan   Dianetics is practiced by several independent Dianetics only groups not connected with Scientology  and also Free Zone or Independent Scientologists  The Church of Scientology has prosecuted a number of people in court for unauthorized publication of Scientology and Dianetics copyrighted material Digital object identifierIn computing  a Digital Object Identifier or DOI is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify objects  standardized by the ISO  An implementation of the Handle System  DOIs are in wide use mainly to identify academic  professional  and government information  such as journal articles  research reports and data sets  and official publications though they also have been used to identify other types of information resources  such as commercial videos  A DOI aims to be  resolvable   usually to some form of access to the information object to which the DOI refers  This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object  such as a URL  indicating where the object can be found  Thus  by being actionable and interoperable  a DOI differs from identifiers such as ISBNs and ISRCs which aim only to uniquely identify their referents  The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model for representing metadata  The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document  whereas its location and other metadata may change  Referring to an online document by its DOI provides more stable linking than simply using its URL  because if its URL changes  the publisher only needs to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL  The developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation  IDF   which introduced it in       Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs  The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF  By late April      more than    million DOI names had been assigned by some       organizations  and by April      this number had grown to    million DOI names assigned through       organizations
