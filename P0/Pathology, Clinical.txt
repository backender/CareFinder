Clinical Medical Biology  France  Belgium  Netherlands  Austria  North and West Africa      is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids  such as blood  urine  and tissue homogenates or extracts using the tools of chemistry  microbiology  hematology and molecular pathology  This specialty requires a medical residency       Licensing and subspecialities    The American Board of Pathology certifies clinical pathologists  and recognizes the following secondary specialties of clinical pathology  Chemical pathology  also called clinical chemistry Hematopathology Blood banking   Transfusion medicine Clinical microbiology Cytogenetics Molecular genetics pathology  In some countries other sub specialities fall under certified Clinical Biologists responsibility  Reproductive biology including Assisted reproductive technology  Sperm bank and Semen analysis Immunopathology      Organization    Clinical pathologists are often medical doctors  In some countries in South America  Europe  Africa or Asia  this specialty can be practiced by non physicians  such as Ph D or Pharm D after a variable number of years of residency        In United States of America     Clinical pathologists work in close collaboration with clinical scientists  clinical biochemists  clinical microbiologists  etc    medical technologists  hospital administrators  and referring physicians to ensure the accuracy and optimal utilization of laboratory testing  Clinical pathology is one of the two major divisions of pathology  the other being anatomical pathology  Often  pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology  a combination sometimes known as general pathology  Similar specialties exist in veterinary pathology  Clinical pathology is itself divided into subspecialties  the main ones being clinical chemistry  clinical hematology blood banking  hematopathology and clinical microbiology and emerging subspecialties such as molecular diagnostics and proteomics  Many areas of clinical pathology overlap with anatomic pathology  Both can serve as medical directors of CLIA certified laboratories  Under the CLIA law  only the US Department of Health and Human Services approved Board Certified Ph D   D Sc  or MD and DO can perform the duties of a Medical or Clinical Laboratory Director  This overlap includes immunoassays  flow cytometry  microbiology and cytogenetics and any assay done on tissue  Overlap between anatomic and clinical pathology is expanding to molecular diagnostics and proteomics as we move towards making the best use of new technologies for personalized medicine        In Europe     Recently  EFLM has chosen the name of  Specialists in Laboratory Medicine  to define all European Clinical pathologists  regardless of their training  M D  Ph D or Pharm D    In France  Clinical Pathology is called Medical Biology   Biologie m dicale   and is practiced by both M D s and Pharm Ds  The residency lasts four years  Specialists in this discipline are called  Biologiste m dical  which literally translates as Clinical Biologist rather than  Clinical pathologist        Place

more rarely a virus        Analyzers     See Automated analyser  The analysers  by the association of robotics and spectrophotometry  allowed these last decades a better reproducibility of the results of proportionings  in particular in medical biochemistry and hematology  The companies of in vitro diagnosis henceforth try to sell chains of automats  i e  a system allowing the automatic transfer of the tubes towards the various types of automats of the same mark  These systems can include the computer assisted management of a serum library  These analysers must undergo daily controls to guarantee a result just possible  one speaks about quality control  These analysers must also undergo daily  weekly and monthly maintenances        Cultures     A big part of the examinations of clinical pathology  primarily in medical microbiology  use culture media  Those allow  for example  the description of one or several infectious agents responsible of the clinical signs        Values
