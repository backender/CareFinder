Child and adolescent psychiatry or Pediatric Psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry that focuses on the diagnosis  treatment  and prevention of mental disorders in children  adolescents  and their families  It investigates the biopsychosocial factors that influence the development and course of these psychiatric disorders and treatment responses to various interventions       History    When psychiatrists and pediatricians first began to recognize and discuss childhood psychiatric disorders in the   th century  they were largely influenced by literary works of the Victorian era  Authors like the Bront  sisters  George Eliot  and Charles Dickens  introduced new ways of thinking about the child mind and the potential influence early childhood experiences could have on child development and the subsequent adult mind  When the Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology  the first psychiatric journal in English  was published in       child psychiatry didn t exist as its own field yet  However  some of the earliest works on the possibility of nervous disorders and  insanity  in children were published in the Journal and several medical writers directly referenced works such as Jane Eyre         Wuthering Heights         Dombey and Son         and David Copperfield         to illustrate this new conceptualization of the child mind  Until that time  it was generally accepted that children were free from nervous disorders and the  passions  that affected the adult mind  As early as       the term  child psychiatry   in French  was used as a subtitle in Manheimer s monograph Les Troubles Mentaux de l Enfance  However  the Swiss psychiatrist Moritz Tramer             was probably the first to define the parameters of child psychiatry in terms of diagnosis  treatment  and prognosis within the discipline of medicine  in       In       Tramer founded the Zeitschrift f r Kinderpsychiatrie  Journal of Child Psychiatry   which later became Acta Paedopsychiatria  The first academic child psychiatry department in the world was founded in      by Leo Kanner              an Austrian  migr  and medical graduate of the University of Berlin  under the direction of Adolf Meyer at the Johns Hopkins Hospital  Baltimore  Kanner was the first physician to be identified as a child psychiatrist in the US and his textbook  Child Psychiatry         is credited with introducing both the specialty and the term to the Anglo phone academic community  In       Kanner established the first formal elective course in child psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins Hospital  In      he provided the first clinical description of early infantile autism  otherwise known as Kanner s Syndrome  In       Jane Addams and her female colleagues established the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute  JPI  in Chicago  later renamed as the Institute for Juvenile Research  IJR   the world s first child guidance clinic  Neurologist William Healy  M D   its first director  was charged with not only studying the delinquent s biological aspects of brain functioning and IQ  but also the delinquent s social factors  attitudes  and motivations  thus it was the birthplace of American child psychiatry  From its establishment in February       the Maudsley  a London based postgraduate teaching and research psychiatric hospital  contained a small children s department  Similar overall early developments took place in many other countries during the late     s and     s  In the United States  child and adolescent psychiatry was established as a recognized medical speciality in      with the founding of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry  but was not established as a legitimate  board certifiable medical speciality until       The use of medication in the treatment of children also began in the     s  when Charles Bradley opened a neuropsychiatric unit and was the first to use amphetamine for brain damaged and hyperactive children  But it wasn t until the     s that the first NIH grant to study pediatric psychopharmacology was awarded  It went to one of Kanner s students  Leon Eisenberg  the second director of the division  The era since the     s flourished  in large part  because of contributions made in the     s  a decade during which child psychiatry witnessed a major evolution as a result of the work carried out by Michael Rutter  The first comprehensive population survey of    to    year olds  carried out in London and the Isle of Wight  which appeared in       addressed questions that have continued to be of importance for child psychiatry  for example  rates of psychiatric disorders  the role of intellectual development and physical impairment  and specific concern for potential social influences on children s adjustment  This work was influential  especially since the investigators demonstrated specific continuities of psychopathology over time  and the influence of social and contextual factors in children s mental health  in their subsequent re evaluation of the original cohort of children  These studies described the prevalence of ADHD  relatively low as compared to the US   identified the onset and prevalence of depression in mid adolescence and the frequent co morbidity with conduct disorder  and explored the relationship between various mental disorders and scholastic achievemment  It was paralleled similarly by work on the epidemiology of autism that was to enormously increase the number of children diagnosed with autism in future years  Although attention had been given in the     s and    s to the classification of childhood psychiatric disorders  and some issues had then been delineated  such as the distinction between neurotic and conduct disorders  the nomenclature did not parallel the growing clinical knowledge  It was claimed that this situation was altered in the late     s with the development of the DSM III system of classification  although research has shown that this system of classification has problems of validity and reliability  Since then  the DSM IV and DSM IVR have altered some of the parsing of psychiatric disorders into  childhood  and  adult  disorders  on the basis that while many psychiatric disorders are not diagnosed until adulthood  they may present in childhood or adolescence  DSM IV   People in the field are sometimes referred to as  neurodevelopmentalists   As of      there was debate in the field as to whether  neurodevelopmentalist  should be made a new speciality       Classification of disorders    Developmental disorders Autistic spectrum disorders including Asperger s disorder Learning disorders Disorders of attention and behaviour Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Oppositional defiant disorder Conduct disorder Psychotic disorders Childhood onset schizophrenia Mood disorders Depression Bipolar disorder Anxiety disorders Panic disorder Phobias Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Eating disorders Anorexia nervosa Bulimia nervosa Gender identity disorder Gender identity disorder in children      Clinical practice          Assessment     The psychiatric assessment of a child or adolescent starts with obtaining a psychiatric history by interviewing the young person and his her parents or caregivers  The assessment includes a detailed exploration of the current concerns about the child s emotional or behavioral problems  the child s physical health and development  history of parental care  including possible abuse and neglect   family relationships and history of parental mental illness  It is regarded as desirable to obtain information from multiple sources  for example both parents  or a parent and a grandparent  as informants may give widely differing accounts of the child s problems  Collateral information is usually obtained from the child s school with regards to academic performance  peer relationships  and behavior in the school environment  Psychiatric assessment always includes a mental state examination of the child or adolescent which consists of a careful behavioral observation and a first hand account of the young person s subjective experiences  The assessment also includes an observation of the interactions within the family  especially the interactions between the child and his her parents  The assessment may be supplemented by the use of behavior or symptom rating scales such as the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist or CBCL  the Behavioral Assessment System for Children or BASC  Connors Rating Scales  used for diagnosis of ADHD   Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory or MACI  and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire or SDQ  These instruments bring a degree of objectivity and consistency to the clinical assessment  More specialized psychometric testing may be carried out by a psychologist  for example using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children  to detect intellectual impairment or other cognitive problems which may be contributing to the child s difficulties        Diagnosis and formulation     The child and adolescent psychiatrist makes a diagnosis based on the pattern of behavior and emotional symptoms  using a standardized set of diagnostic criteria such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  DSM IV TR  or the International Classification of Diseases  ICD      While the DSM system is widely used  it may not adequately take into account social  cultural and contextual factors and it has been suggested that an individualized clinical formulation may be more useful  A case formulation is standard practice for child and adolescent psychiatrists and can be defined as a process of integrating and summarizing all the relevant factors implicated in the development of the patient s problem  including biological  psychological  social and cultural perspectives  the  biopsychosocial model    The applicability of DSM diagnoses have also been questioned with regard to the assessment of very young children  it is argued that very young children are developing too rapidly to be adequately described by a fixed diagnosis  and furthermore that a diagnosis unhelpfully locates the problem within the child when the parent child relationship is a more appropriate focus of assessment  The child and adolescent psychiatrist then designs a treatment plan which considers all the components and discusses these recommendations with the child or adolescent and family        Treatment     Treatment will usually involve one or more of the following elements  behavior therapy  cognitive behavior therapy  problem solving therapies  psychodynamic therapy  parent training programs  family therapy  and or the use of medication  The intervention can also include consultation with pediatricians  primary care physicians or professionals from schools  juvenile courts  social agencies or other community organizations       Training    In the United States  Child and adolescent psychiatric training requires   years of medical school  at least   years of approved residency training in medicine  neurology  and general psychiatry with adults  and   years of additional specialized training in psychiatric work with children  adolescents  and their families in an accredited residency in child and adolescent psychiatry  Child and adolescent sub speciality training is similar in other Western countries  such as the UK  New Zealand  and Australia   in that trainees must generally demonstrate competency in general adult psychiatry prior to commencing sub speciality training        Certification and continuing education     In the US  having completed the child and adolescent psychiatry residency  the child and adolescent psychiatrist is eligible to take the additional certification examination in the subspecialty of child and adolescent psychiatry from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology  ABPN  or the American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry  AOBNP   Although the ABPN and AOBNP examinations are not required for practice  they are a further assurance that the child and adolescent psychiatrist with these certifications can be expected to diagnose and treat all psychiatric conditions in patients of any age competently  Training requirements are listed on the web site of The American Academy of Child   Adolescent Psychiatry        Shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists     The demand for child and adolescent psychiatrists continues to far outstrip the supply worldwide  There is also a severe maldistribution of child and adolescent psychiatrists  especially in rural and poor  urban areas where access is significantly reduced  There are currently only approximately       practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists in the United States  A report by the US Bureau of Health Professions        projected a need in the year      for        child and adolescent psychiatrists  but a supply of only        In its      report  the Center for Mental Health Services estimated that       of    to    year olds had serious emotional disturbances  and      had extreme functional impairments  However  in       the Surgeon General reported that  there is a dearth of child psychiatrists   Only     of emotionally disturbed children and adolescents received any mental health treatment  a tiny percentage of which was performed by child and adolescent psychiatrists  Furthermore  the US Bureau of Health Professions projects that the demand for child and adolescent psychiatry services will increase by      between      and             Cross cultural considerations     Steady growth in migration of immigrants to higher income regions and countries has contributed to the growth and interest in cross cultural psychiatry  Families of immigrants whose child has a psychiatric illness must come to understand the disorder while navigating an unfamiliar health care system       Criticisms          Subjective diagnoses     One criticism against psychiatry is that psychiatric diagnoses lack  objectivity   particularly when compared with diagnosis in other medical specialties  However  for several major psychiatric disorders interrater reliability  which shows the degree to which psychiatrists agree on the diagnosis  is generally similar to those in other medical specialties  In       Allen Frances said that  psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests   Traditional deficit and disease models of child psychiatry have been criticized as rooted in the medical model which conceptualizes adjustment problems in terms of disease states  It is said by these critics that these normative models explicitly characterize problematic behavior as representing a disorder within the child or young person and these commentators assert that the role of environmental influences on behavior has become increasingly neglected  leading to a decrease in the popularity of  for example  family therapy  There are criticisms of the medical model approach from within and without the psychiatric profession  see references   it is said to neglect the role of environmental  family  and cultural influences  to discount the psychological meaning of behavior and symptoms  to promote a view of the  patient  as dependent and needing to be cured or cared for and therefore undermines a sense of personal responsibility for conduct and behavior  to promote a normative conception based on adaptation to the norms of society  the ill person must adapt to society   and to be based on the shaky foundations of reliance on a classificatory system that has been shown to have problems of validity and reliability  Boorse        Jensen        Sadler et al        Timimi               Over prescription of psychoactive drugs     Since the late     s  use of psychiatric medication has become increasibly common for children and adolescents  In      the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  issued the Black Box Warning on antidepressant prescriptions to alert patients of a research link between use of medication and apparent increased risk of suicidal thoughts  hostility  and agitation in pediatric patients  The most common diagnoses for which children receive psychiatric medication are ADHD  ODD  and conduct disorder  Some research suggests that children and adolescents are sometimes given antipsychotic drugs as a first line treatment for mental health problems or behavioral issues other than a psychotic disorder  which is not the ideal treatment approach for these drugs  In the United States  the usage of these drugs in young people has greatly increased since       especially among children from low income families  More research is needed to specifically assess the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic medications in pediatric populations  Because of the risk of weight gain  metabolic side effects  and cardiovascular changes with antipsychotic use  the use of the drugs in pediatric populations is highly scrutinized        Electroconvulsive therapy     In       child neuropsychiatrist Lauretta Bender published a study on    children aged between four and eleven years old who had been treated in the previous five years with intensive courses of electroconvulsive therapy  ECT   These children received ECT daily for a typical course of approximately twenty treatments  This formed part of an experimental trend amongst a cadre of psychiatrists to explore the therapeutic impact of intensive regimes of ECT  which is also known as either regressive ECT or annihilation therapy  In the     s Bender abandoned ECT as a therapeutic practice for the treatment of children  In the same decade the results of her published work on the use of ECT in children was discredited after a study showing that the condition of the children so treated had either not improved or deteriorated  Commenting on his experience as part of Bender s therapeutic program  Ted Chabasinski said that   It really made a mess of me     I went from being a shy kid who read a lot to a terrified kid who cried all the time   Following his treatment  he spent ten years as an inmate of Rockland State Hospital  a psychiatric facility now known as the Rockland Psychiatric Center
