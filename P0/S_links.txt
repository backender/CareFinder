includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the  th century BC to the  th century AD  It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period   th to  th centuries BC   Classical period   th and  th centuries BC   and Hellenistic period   rd century BC to the  th century AD   It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek  The language of the Hellenistic phase is known as Koine  common   Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own  although in its earliest form it closely resembled Attic Greek and in its latest form it approaches Medieval Greek  Prior to the Koine period  Greek of the classic and earlier periods included several regional dialects  Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of fifth century Athenian historians  playwrights  and philosophers  It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the Western world since the Renaissance  This article primarily contains information about the Epic and Classical phases of the language Andalusian SpanishThe Andalusian varieties of Spanish  Spanish  andaluz  anda lu     lus   Andalusian    nda lu     l     are spoken in Andalusia  Ceuta  Melilla  and Gibraltar  They include perhaps the most distinct of the southern variants of peninsular Spanish  differing in many respects from northern varieties  and also from Standard Spanish  Due to the large population of Andalusia  the Andalusian dialects are among the ones with more speakers in Spain  Within Spain  other southern dialects of Spanish share some core elements of Andalusian in terms of phonetics  syntax and vocabulary   notably Canarian Spanish  Extremaduran Spanish and Murcian Spanish as well as  to a lesser degree  Manchegan Spanish  Due to massive emigration from Andalusia to the Spanish colonies in the Americas and elsewhere  most American Spanish dialects share some fundamental characteristics with Western Andalusian Spanish  such as the use of ustedes instead of vosotros for the second person plural  and seseo  Many varieties of Spanish  such as Canarian Spanish  Caribbean Spanish and other Latin American Spanish dialects  including their standard dialects  are considered by most to be based on Andalusian Spanish Archaic Greek alphabetsMany local variants of the Greek alphabet were employed in ancient Greece during the archaic and early classical periods  until they were replaced by the classical    letter alphabet that is the standard today  around     BC  All forms of the Greek alphabet were originally based on the shared inventory of the    symbols of the Phoenician alphabet  with the exception of the letter Samekh  whose Greek counterpart Xi     was used only in a sub group of Greek alphabets  and with the common addition of Upsilon     for the vowel  u      The local  so called epichoric  alphabets differed in many ways  in the use of the consonant symbols      and    in the use of the innovative long vowel letters    and     in the absence or presence of   in its original consonant function   h    in the use or non use of certain archaic letters       w        k        s    and in many details of the individual shapes of each letter  The system now familiar as the standard    letter Greek alphabet was originally the regional variant of the Ionian cities in Asia Minor  It was officially adopted in Athens in     BC and in most of the rest of the Greek world by the middle of the  th century BC BB or b  pronounced   bi    bee  is the second letter in the

or stroke is a modification consisting of a line drawn through a grapheme  It may be used as a diacritic to derive new letters from old ones  or simply as an addition to make a grapheme more distinct from others  It can take the form of a vertical bar  slash  or crossbar  A stroke is sometimes drawn through the numbers   and    to make them more distinguishable  In phonetic transcription  a stroke through a letter often indicates that the sound is a fricative  For the specific usages of various letters with bars and strokes  see their individual articles  In Unicode  there are bars at U

lettre b tarde in French  was a blackletter script used in France  the Burgundian Netherlands and Germany during the   th and   th centuries  The Burgundian variant of script can be seen as the court script of the Dukes of Burgundy and was used to produce some of the most magnificent manuscripts of the   th century  The early printers produced regional versions in type which were used especially to print texts in the vernacular languages  more rarely for Latin texts  The earliest bastarda type was produced by Gutenberg in            The main variety was the one used in France  which was also found in Geneva  Antwerp and London  Another local variety was found in the Netherlands  Caxton s first types were a rather poor copy of this  The French lettre b tarde passed out of use by the mid   th century but the German variety developed into the national Fraktur type which remained in use until the mid twentieth century  British typeface designer Jonathan Barnbrook has designed a contemporary interpretation titled Bastard   BrailleBraille   bre l   French pronunciation    b aj   is a tactile writing system used by people who are blind or visually impaired  It is traditionally written with embossed paper  Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports thanks to refreshable braille displays  They can write braille with the original slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer  such as a portable braille note taker  or on a computer that prints with a braille embosser  Braille is named after its creator  Frenchman Louis Braille  who lost his eyesight due to a childhood accident  In       at the age of     Braille developed his code for the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing  He published his system  which subsequently included musical notation  in       The second revision  published in       was the first binary form of writing developed in the modern era  Braille characters are small rectangular blocks called cells that contain tiny palpable bumps called raised dots  The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another  Since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes of printed writing systems  the mappings  sets of character designations  vary from language to language  Furthermore  in English Braille there are three levels of encoding  Grade     a letter by letter transcription used for basic literacy  Grade     an addition of abbreviations and contractions  and Grade     various non standardized personal shorthands  Braille cells are not the only thing to appear in braille text  There may be embossed illustrations and graphs  with the lines either solid or made of series of dots  arrows  bullets that are larger than braille dots  etc  A full Braille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two lateral rows each having three dots  The dot positions are identified by numbers from one through six     solutions are possible from using one or more dots  A single cell can be used to represent an alphabet letter  number  punctuation mark  or even an entire word  In the face of screen reader software  braille usage has declined  However  braille education remains important for developing reading skills among blind and visually impaired children  and braille literacy correlates with higher employment rates Braille pattern dots    The Braille pattern dots           is a   dot braille cell with the top right  and middle and bottom left dots raised  or an   dot braille cell with the top right and both middle left dots raised

b azi lej u   is a set of dialects of the Portuguese language used mostly in Brazil  It is spoken by virtually all of the     million inhabitants of Brazil and spoken widely across the Brazilian diaspora  today consisting of about two million Brazilians who have emigrated to other countries  This variety of the Portuguese language differs  particularly in phonology and prosody  from varieties and dialects spoken in most Portuguese speaking majority countries  including native Portugal and African countries   the dialects of which  partly because of the more recent end of Portuguese colonialism in these regions  tend to have a closer connection to contemporary European Portuguese  Despite this  Brazilian and European Portuguese vary little in formal writing  in many ways analogous to the differences encountered between American and British English   In       the Community of Portuguese Language Countries  CPLP   which included representatives from all countries with Portuguese as the official language  reached an agreement on the reform of the Portuguese orthography to unify the two standards then in use by Brazil on one side and the remaining Lusophone countries on the other  This spelling reform went into effect in Brazil on   January       In Portugal  the reform was signed into law by the President on    July      allowing for a   year adaptation period  during which both orthographies co existed  All of the CPLP countries have signed the reform  In Brazil  this reform will be in force as of January       Portugal and other Portuguese speaking countries have since begun using the new orthography  Regional varieties of Brazilian Portuguese  while remaining mutually intelligible  may diverge from each other in matters such as vowel pronunciation and speech intonation CC is the third letter in the English alphabet and a letter of the alphabets of many other writing systems which inherited it from the Latin alphabet  It is also the third letter of the ISO basic Latin alphabet  It is named cee  pronounced   si    in English Carolingian minusculeCarolingian or Caroline minuscule is a script which developed as a calligraphic standard in Europe so that the Latin alphabet could be easily recognized by the literate class from one region to another  It was developed for the first time  in about      by the Benedictine monks of Corbie Abbey  about     km north of Paris   It was used in the Holy Roman Empire between approximately     and       Codices  pagan and Christian texts  and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule throughout the Carolingian Renaissance  The script developed into blackletter and became obsolete  though its revival in the Italian Renaissance forms the basis of more recent scripts Cool SThe Cool S  also known as Skater S  Superman S  Stussy S  Super S  Pointy S  and many other names  is a graffiti signature of popular culture that is typically doodled on children s notebooks or graffitied on walls Coptic alphabetThe Coptic alphabet is the script used for writing the Coptic language  The repertoire of glyphs is based on the Greek alphabet augmented by letters borrowed from the Egyptian Demotic and is the first alphabetic script used for the Egyptian language  There are several Coptic alphabets  as the Coptic writing system may vary greatly among the various dialects and subdialects of the Coptic language CumaeCumae  Ancient Greek        Kum   or        Kumai  or       Kuma   Italian  Cuma  was an ancient city of Magna Graecia on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea  Founded by settlers from Euboea in the  th century BC  Cumae was the first Greek colony on the mainland of Italy and the seat of the Cumaean Sibyl  The ruins of the city lie near the modern village of Cuma  a frazione of the comune Bacoli in the Province of Naples  Campania  Italy Cyrillic scriptThe Cyrillic script  s  r l k  is a writing system used for various alphabets across eastern Europe and north and central Asia  It is based on the Early Cyrillic  which was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the  th century AD at the Preslav Literary School  It is the basis of alphabets used in various languages  past and present  in parts of southeastern Europe and northern Eurasia  especially those of Slavic origin  and non Slavic languages influenced by Russian  As of       around     million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages  with Russia accounting for about half of them  With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on   January       Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union  following the Latin script and Greek script  Cyrillic is derived from the Greek uncial script  augmented by letters from the older Glagolitic alphabet  including some ligatures  These additional letters were used for Old Church Slavonic sounds not found in Greek  The script is named in honor of the two Byzantine brothers  Saints Cyril and Methodius  who created the Glagolitic alphabet earlier on  Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by early disciples of Cyril and Methodius  In the early   th century the Cyrillic script used in Russia was heavily reformed by Peter the Great  who had recently returned from his Grand Embassy in western Europe  The new form of letters became closer to the Latin alphabet  several archaic letters were removed and several letters were personally designed by Peter the Great  such as   which was inspired by Latin R   West European typography culture was also adopted DD  named dee   di    is the fourth letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet DiacriticA diacritic   also diacritical mark  diacritical point  or diacritical sign   is a glyph added to a letter  or basic glyph  The term derives from the Ancient Greek              diakritik s   distinguishing    from           diakr  n    to distinguish    Diacritic is primarily an adjective  though sometimes used as a noun  whereas diacritical is only ever an adjective  Some diacritical marks  such as the acute       and grave        are often called accents  Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter  or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters  The main use of diacritical marks in the Latin script is to change the sound values of the letters to which they are added  Examples from English are the diaereses in na ve and No l  which show that the vowel with the diaeresis mark is pronounced separately from the preceding vowel  the acute and grave accents  which can indicate that a final vowel is to be pronounced  as in sak  and poetic breath d  and the cedilla under the  c  in the borrowed French word fa ade  which shows it is pronounced  s  rather than  k   In other Latin alphabets  they may distinguish between homonyms  such as the French l    there   versus la   the   that are both pronounced  la   In Gaelic type  a dot over a consonant indicates lenition of the consonant in question  In other alphabetic systems  diacritical marks may perform other functions  Vowel pointing systems  namely the Arabic harakat               etc   and the Hebrew niqqud                       etc   systems  indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet  The Indic virama     etc   and the Arabic suk n         mark the absence of a vowel  Cantillation marks indicate prosody  Other uses include the Early Cyrillic titlo        and the Hebrew gershayim        which  respectively  mark abbreviations or acronyms  and Greek diacritical marks  which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as numerals  In the Hanyu Pinyin official romanization system for Chinese  diacritics are used to mark the tones of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur  In orthography and collation  a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new  distinct letter or as a letter diacritic combination  This varies from language to language  and may vary from case to case within a language  In some cases  letters are used as  in line diacritics   with the same function as ancillary glyphs  in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them  as in the case of the  h  in the English pronunciation of  sh  and  th  Dollar signThe dollar sign    or   is a symbol primarily used to indicate the various units of currency around the world  The symbol can interchangeably have one or two vertical strokes  Note that the two stroked version is not the same symbol as the cifr o  In common usage  the sign appears to the left of the amount specified  as in     read  one dollar  Doric GreekDoric or Dorian was an Ancient Greek dialect  Its variants were spoken in the southern and eastern Peloponnese  as well as in Sicily  Epirus  Macedonia  Southern Italy  Crete  Rhodes  some islands in the southern Aegean Sea and some cities on the south east coast of Anatolia  Together with Northwest Greek  it forms the  Western group  of classical Greek dialects  By Hellenistic times  under the Achaean League  an Achaean Doric koin  language appeared  exhibiting many peculiarities common to all Doric dialects  which delayed the spread of the Attic based Koine Greek to the Peloponnese until the second century BC  It is widely accepted that Doric originated in the mountains of Epirus and Macedonia  northwestern Greece  the original seat of the Dorians  It was expanded to all other regions during the Dorian invasion  c       BC  and the colonisations that followed  The presence of a Doric state  Doris  in central Greece  north of the Gulf of Corinth  led to the theory that Doric had originated in northwest Greece or maybe beyond in the Balkans  The dialect s distribution towards the north extends to the Megarian colony of Byzantium and the Corinthian colonies of Potidaea  Epidamnos  Apollonia and Ambracia  there  it further added words to what would become the Albanian language  probably via traders from a now extinct Illyrian intermediary  Local epigraphical evidence is restricted to the decrees of the Epirote League and the Pella curse tablet  both in the early fourth century BC   as well to the Doric eponym Machatas first attested in Macedonia  early  th century BC  Dot  diacritic When used as a diacritic mark  the term dot is usually reserved for the Interpunct        or to the glyphs  combining dot above         and  combining dot below         which may be combined with some letters of the extended Latin alphabets in use in Central European languages and Vietnamese Duenos InscriptionThe Duenos inscription is one of the earliest known Old Latin texts  variously dated from the  th to the  th century BC  It is inscribed on the sides of a kernos  in this case a trio of small globular vases adjoined by three clay struts  It was found by Heinrich Dressel in      on the Quirinal Hill in Rome  The kernos belongs to the Staatliche Museen in Berlin  inventory no            The inscription is written right to left in three units  without spaces to separate words  It is difficult to translate  as some letters are hard to distinguish  particularly since they cannot always be deduced by context  The absence of spaces causes additional difficulty in assigning the letters to the respective words   EE

Germanic Futhark  is the oldest form of the runic alphabets  It was a writing system used by Germanic tribes for the northwestern and Migration Period dialects  Its inscriptions are found on artifacts  including jewelry  amulets  tools  weapons  and runestones  from the  nd to  th centuries  In Scandinavia  from the late  th century  the script was simplified to the Younger Futhark  while the Anglo Saxons and Frisians extended the Futhark which eventually became the Anglo Saxon futhorc  Unlike the Anglo Saxon and Younger Futharks  which remained in use during the Early and High Middle Ages  respectively  knowledge of how to read the Elder Futhark was forgotten until       when it was deciphered by Norwegian scholar Sophus Bugge English alphabetThe modern English alphabet is a Latin alphabet consisting of    letters  each having an uppercase and a lowercase form    the exact same letters that are found in the ISO basic Latin alphabet   The exact shape of printed letters varies depending on the typeface  nowadays commonly referred to as a font   The shape of handwritten letters can differ significantly from the standard printed form  and between individuals   especially when written in cursive style  See the individual letter articles for information about letter shapes and origins  follow the links on any of the uppercase letters above   Written English uses    digraphs  such as ch  sh  th  ph  wh  etc   but they are not considered separate letters of the alphabet  Some traditions also use two ligatures    and    or consider the ampersand     part of the alphabet English languageEnglish      l    is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now the global lingua franca  Named after the Angles  one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England  it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia  Angeln  peninsula in the Baltic Sea  It is most closely related to the Frisian languages  although its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages in the early medieval period  and later by Romance languages  particularly French  English is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost    sovereign states  It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom  the United States  Canada  Australia  Ireland  and New Zealand  and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean  Africa  and South Asia  It is the third most common native language in the world  after Mandarin and Spanish  It is the most widely learned second language and an official language of the United Nations  of the European Union  and of many other world and regional international organisations  It is the most widely spoken Germanic language  accounting for at least     of speakers of this Indo European branch  English has developed over the course of more than       years  The earliest forms of English  a set of Anglo Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo Saxon settlers in the fifth century  are called Old English  Middle English began in the late   th century with the Norman conquest of England  and was a period in which the language was influenced by French  Early Modern English began in the late   th century with the introduction of the printing press to London and the King James Bible  and the start of the Great Vowel Shift  Through the worldwide influence of the British Empire  modern English spread around the world from the   th to mid   th centuries  Through all types of printed and electronic media  as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower  English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and in professional contexts such as science  navigation  and law  Modern English has little inflection compared with many other languages  and relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses  aspect and mood  as well as passive constructions  interrogatives and some negation  Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions   in terms of phonetics and phonology  and sometimes also vocabulary  grammar and spelling   English speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease Es  Cyrillic Es       italics       is a letter of the Cyrillic script  It commonly represents the voiceless alveolar fricative  s   like the pronunciation of  s  in  sand   In German orthography  the grapheme    called Eszett  IPA    s ts t   or scharfes S  IPA     a   f s    s      a  f s    s    in English  sharp S  represents the  s  phoneme in Standard German  specifically when following long vowels and diphthongs  while ss is used after short vowels  The name Eszett represents the German pronunciation of the two letters S and Z  It originates as the sz digraph as used in Old High German and Middle High German orthography  represented as a ligature of long s and tailed z in blackletter typography       which became conflated with the ligature for long s and round s   s  used in Roman type  The grapheme has an intermediate position between letter and ligature  It behaves as a ligature in that it has no separate position in the alphabet  In alphabetical order it is treated as the equivalent of  ss   not  sz    It also has no traditional capital form  although some type designers have introduced forms of  capital    de facto   It behaves like a letter in that its use is prescribed by orthographical rules and conveys phonological information  use of   indicates that the preceding vowel is long   While   has been used as a ligature for the  ss  digraph in early modern printing for languages other than German  its use in modern typography is limited to the German language  In the   th century  it has fallen out of use completely in Swiss Standard German  used in Switzerland and

scriptOld Italic is one of several now extinct alphabet systems used on the Italian Peninsula in ancient times for various Indo European languages  predominantly Italic  and non Indo European  e g  Etruscan  languages  The alphabets derive from the Euboean Greek Cumaean alphabet  used at Ischia and Cumae in the Bay of Naples in the eighth century BC  Various Indo European languages belonging to the Italic branch  Faliscan and members of the Sabellian group  including Oscan  Umbrian  and South Picene  and other Indo European branches such as Celtic  Venetic and Messapic  originally used the alphabet  Faliscan  Oscan  Umbrian  North Picene  and South Picene all derive from an Etruscan form of the alphabet  The Germanic runic alphabet was derived from one of these alphabets by the  nd century AD Etruscan languageThe Etruscan language     tr sk n   was the spoken and written language of the Etruscan civilization  in Italy  in the ancient region of Etruria  modern Tuscany plus western Umbria and northern Latium  and in parts of Campania  Lombardy  Veneto  and Emilia Romagna  where the Etruscans were displaced by Gauls   Etruscan influenced Latin  but was eventually completely superseded by it  The Etruscans left around        inscriptions which have been found so far  only a small minority of which are of significant length  some bilingual inscriptions with texts also in Latin  Greek  or Phoenician  and a few dozen loanwords  such as the name Roma  from Etruscan Ruma   but Etruscan s influence was significant  Attested from     BC to AD     the relation of Etruscan to other languages has been a source of long running speculation and study  with it being referred to at times as an isolate  one of the Tyrsenian languages  and a number of other less well known possibilities  Grammatically  the language is agglutinating  with nouns and verbs showing suffixed inflectional endings and ablaut in some cases  Nouns show four cases  singular and plural numbers  and masculine and feminine genders  Phonologically  Etruscan appears uncomplicated  with a four vowel system and an apparent contrast between aspirated and unaspirated stops  The language shows phonetic change over time  with the loss and then re establishment of word internal vowels due to the effect of Etruscan s strong word initial stress  Etruscan religion influenced that of the Romans and many of the few surviving Etruscan language artifacts are of votive or religious significance  Etruscan was written in an alphabet derived from the Greek alphabet  this alphabet was the source of the Latin alphabet  The Etruscan language is also believed to be the source of certain important cultural words of Western Europe such as  military  and  people   which do not have obvious Indo European roots Etruscan civilizationThe Etruscan civilization     tr sk n   is the modern name given to a powerful  wealthy and refined civilization of ancient Italy in the area corresponding roughly to Tuscany  western Umbria  and northern Lazio  As distinguished by its unique language  this civilization endured from before the time of the earliest Etruscan inscriptions  c      BC  until its assimilation into the Roman Republic  beginning in the late  th century B C E with the Roman Etruscan Wars  Culture that is identifiably Etruscan developed in Italy after about     B C E  approximately over the range of the preceding Iron Age Villanovan culture  The latter gave way in the  th century to a culture that was influenced by ancient Greece  Magna Graecia  and Phoenicia  At its maximum extent  during the foundational period of Rome and the Roman Kingdom  Etruscan civilization flourished in three confederacies of cities  of Etruria  of the Po Valley with the eastern Alps  and of Latium and Campania  The decline was gradual  but by     BC the political destiny of Italy had passed out of Etruscan hands  The last Etruscan cities were formally absorbed by Rome around     BC  Although the Etruscans developed a system of writing  the Etruscan language remains only partly understood  and only a handful of texts of any length survive  making modern understanding of their society and culture heavily dependent on much later and generally disapproving Roman sources  Politics were based on the small city  and probably the family unit  In their heyday  the Etruscan elite grew very rich through trade with the Celtic world to the north and the Greeks to the south  and filled their large family tombs with imported luxuries  Archaic Greece had a huge influence on their art and architecture  and Greek mythology was evidently very familiar to them  The latest mitochondrial DNA study        shows that Etruscans appear to fall very close to a Neolithic population from Central Europe and to other Tuscan populations  and are ancestral to the modern inhabitants of Casentino and Volterra  The study also excluded recent Anatolian connection European PortugueseEuropean

FrakturFraktur  German   f ak tu     is a calligraphic hand of the Latin alphabet and any of several blackletter typefaces derived from this hand  The blackletter lines are broken up  that is  their forms contain many angles when compared to the smooth curves of the Antiqua  common  typefaces modeled after antique Roman square capitals and Carolingian minuscule  From this  Fraktur is sometimes contrasted with the  Latin alphabet  in northern European texts  which is sometimes called the  German alphabet   simply being a typeface of the Latin alphabet  Similarly  the term  Fraktur  or  Gothic  is sometimes applied to all of the blackletter typefaces  known in German as Gebrochene Schrift   Broken Script    Here is the English alphabet in Fraktur

vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo European language family  A portion of German words are derived from Latin and Greek  and fewer are borrowed from French and English  With slightly different standardized variants  German  Austrian  and Swiss Standard German   German is a pluricentric language  Like English  German is also notable for its broad spectrum of dialects  with many unique varieties existing in Europe and also other parts of the world  Due to the limited intelligibility between certain varieties and Standard German  as well as the lack of an undisputed  scientific difference between a  dialect  and a  language   some German varieties or dialect groups  e g  Low German or Plautdietsch  are alternatively referred to as  languages  and  dialects  German orthographyGerman orthography is the orthography used in writing the German language  which is largely phonemic  However  it shows many instances of spellings that are historic or analogous to other spellings rather than phonemic  The pronunciation of almost every word can be derived from its spelling once the spelling rules are known  but the opposite is not generally the case  Today  German orthography is regulated by the Rat f r deutsche Rechtschreibung  Council for German Orthography   composed of representatives from most German speaking countries Gothic alphabetThe Gothic alphabet is an alphabet for writing the Gothic language  created in the  th century by Ulfilas  or Wulfila  for the purpose of translating the Bible  The alphabet is essentially a uncial form of the Greek alphabet  with a few additional letters to account for Gothic phonology  Latin F and G  a questionably Runic letter to distinguish the  w  glide from vocalic  u   and the letter  air to express the Gothic labiovelar  It is completely different from the  Gothic script  of the Middle Ages  a script used to write the Latin alphabet Grammatical personGrammatical person  in linguistics  is the grammatical distinction between deictic references to participant s  in an event  typically the distinction is between the speaker  first person   the addressee  second person   and others  third person   Put in simple colloquial English  first person is literally  I   Second person is literally  you   third person is everything else  the rest  everything that is not literally  I   not literally  you   Grammatical person typically defines a language s set of personal pronouns  It also frequently affects verbs  sometimes nouns  and possessive relationships Greek alphabetThe Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late  th century BC or early  th century BC It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet  and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants  It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts  Apart from its use in writing the Greek language  in both its ancient and its modern forms  the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics  science and other fields  In its classical and modern forms  the alphabet has    letters  ordered from alpha to omega  Like Latin and Cyrillic  Greek originally had only a single form of each letter  it developed the letter case distinction between upper case and lower case forms in parallel with Latin during the modern era  Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek usage  because the pronunciation of Greek has changed significantly between the  th century BC and today  Modern and Ancient Greek use different diacritics  The traditional orthography  which is used for Ancient Greek and sometimes for Modern Greek  has many diacritics  such as accent marks for pitch accent   polytonic    the breathing marks for the presence and absence of the initial  h  sound  and the iota subscript for the final historical  i  sound  In standard Modern Greek spelling  orthography has been simplified to the monotonic system  which uses only two diacritics  the acute accent and diaeresis HH  named aitch   e t

Greek pronunciation   h   r  do tos   was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire  modern day Bodrum  Turkey  and lived in the fifth century BC  c      c      BC   a contemporary of Socrates  He is often referred to as  The Father of History   first conferred by Cicero   he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigation specifically  by collecting his materials systematically and critically  and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative  The Histories is the only work which he is known to have produced  a record of his  inquiry   or         histor a  on the origins of the Greco Persian Wars  including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information  Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate  yet he states that he was reporting only what he was told  a sizable portion of the information he provided was later confirmed by historians and archaeologists  Despite Herodotus  historical significance  little is known of his personal life and academic history Histories  Herodotus The Histories  Greek            Ancient Greek   his to r  ai    also known as The History  of Herodotus is now considered the founding work of history in Western literature  Written in     BC in the Ionic dialect of classical Greek  The Histories serves as a record of the ancient traditions  politics  geography  and clashes of various cultures that were known in Western Asia  Northern Africa and Greece at that time  Although not a fully impartial record  it remains one of the West s most important sources regarding these affairs  Moreover  it established the genre and study of history in the Western world  despite the existence of historical records and chronicles beforehand   The Histories also stands as one of the first accounts of the rise of the Persian Empire  as well as the events and causes of the Greco Persian Wars between the Achaemenid Empire and the Greek city states in the  th century BC  Herodotus portrays the conflict as one between the forces of slavery  the Persians  on the one hand  and freedom  the Athenians and the confederacy of Greek city states which united against the invaders  on the other  The Histories was at some point divided into the nine books that appear in modern editions  conventionally named after

reliable reference work and educational tool History of the Latin alphabetThe Latin alphabet is the most widely used alphabetic writing system in the world  It is the standard script of the English language and is often referred to simply as  the alphabet  in English  It is a true alphabet which originated in the  th century BC in Italy and has changed continually over the last      years  It has roots in the Semitic alphabet and its offshoot alphabets  the Phoenician  Greek  and Etruscan  The phonetic values of some letters changed  some letters were lost and gained  and several writing styles   hands   developed  Two such styles  the minuscule and majuscule hands  were combined into one script with alternate forms for the lower and upper case letters  Due to classicism  modern uppercase letters differ only slightly from their classical counterparts  There are few regional variants Hungarian languageHungarian is the official language of Hungary and one of the    official languages of the European Union  Outside Hungary it is also spoken by communities of Hungarian people in neighbouring countries  especially in Romania  Slovakia  Serbia and Croatia   and by Hungarian diaspora communities worldwide  Like Finnish and Estonian  it belongs to the Uralic language family  its closest relatives being Mansi and Khanty  It is one of several European languages not part of the Indo European languages  and the most widely spoken European language that does not belong to the Indo European family  The Hungarian name for the language is magyarul   m   r  or magyar nyelv

basic Latin alphabet NATO phonetic alphabetThe International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet  commonly known as the ICAO phonetic alphabet  sometimes called the NATO alphabet or spelling alphabet and the ITU radiotelephonic or phonetic alphabet  is the most widely used radiotelephonic spelling alphabet  Although often called  phonetic alphabets   spelling alphabets are not associated with phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet  Instead  the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet  so that critical combinations of letters and numbers can be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of language barriers or the quality of the communication channel  The    code words in the NATO phonetic alphabet are assigned to the    letters of the English alphabet in alphabetical order as follows  Alfa  Bravo  Charlie

name of a set of ISO standards  described as Information technology   ISO   bit coded character set for information interchange and developed in cooperation with ASCII at least since       Since its first edition in      it has specified a   bit character code from which several national standards are derived  ISO IEC     was also ratified by ECMA as ECMA    The first version of ECMA   had been published in       based on work the ECMA s Technical Committee TC  had carried out since December       Characters in the ISO IEC     Basic Character Set are invariant characters  Since that portion of ISO IEC      that is the invariant character set shared by all countries  specified only those letters used in the ISO basic Latin alphabet  countries using additional letters needed to create national variants of ISO     to be able to use their native scripts  Since universal acceptance of the   bit byte did not exist at that time  the national characters had to be made to fit within the constraints of   bits  meaning that some characters that appear in ASCII do not appear in other national variants of ISO     ISO basic Latin alphabetThe ISO basic Latin alphabet is a Latin script alphabet and consists of two sets of    letters  codified in various national and international standards and used widely in international communication  The two sets contain the following    letters each Integral symbolThe integral symbol     Unicode                                                                   displaystyle  displaystyle  int       LaTeX  is used to denote integrals and

and was chosen because Leibniz thought of the integral as an infinite sum of infinitesimal summands International Phonetic AlphabetThe International Phonetic Alphabet  IPA  is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin alphabet  It was devised by the International Phonetic Association as a standardized representation of the sounds of spoken language  The IPA is used by lexicographers  foreign language students and teachers  linguists  speech language pathologists  singers  actors  constructed language creators  and translators  The IPA is designed to represent only those qualities of speech that are part of oral language  phones  phonemes  intonation  and the separation of words and syllables  To represent additional qualities of speech  such as tooth gnashing  lisping  and sounds made with a cleft lip and cleft palate  an extended set of symbols  the extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet  may be used  IPA symbols are composed of one or more elements of two basic types  letters and diacritics  For example  the sound of the English letter  t  may be transcribed in IPA with a single letter   t   or with a letter plus diacritics   t     depending on how precise one wishes to be  Often  slashes are used to signal broad or phonemic transcription  thus   t  is less specific than  and could refer to  either  t    or  t   depending on the context and language  Occasionally letters or diacritics are added  removed  or modified by the International Phonetic Association  As of the most recent change in       there are     letters     diacritics  and four prosodic marks in the IPA  These are shown in the current IPA chart  posted below in this article and at the website of the IPA International Standard Book NumberThe International Standard Book Number  ISBN  is a unique numeric commercial book identifier  An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation  except reprintings  of a book  For example  an e book  a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN  The ISBN is    digits long if assigned on or after   January       and    digits long if assigned before       The method of assigning an ISBN is nation based and varies from country to country  often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country  The initial ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in      based upon the   digit Standard Book Numbering  SBN  created in       The    digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization  ISO  and was published in      as international standard ISO       the SBN code can be converted to a ten digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero   Occasionally  a book may appear without a printed ISBN if it is printed privately or the author does not follow the usual ISBN procedure  however  this can be rectified later  Another identifier  the International Standard Serial Number  ISSN   identifies periodical publications such as magazines  and the International Standard Music Number  ISMN  covers for musical scores International maritime signal flagsInternational maritime signal flags refers to various flags used to communicate with ships  The principal system of flags and associated codes is the International Code of Signals  Various navies have flag systems with additional flags and codes

messenger of God  It is the world s second largest religion and the fastest growing major religion in the world  with over     billion followers or     of the global population  known as Muslims  Islam teaches that God is merciful  all powerful  and unique  and He has guided mankind through revealed scriptures  natural signs  and a line of prophets sealed by Muhammad  The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran  viewed by Muslims as the verbatim word of God  and the teachings and normative example  called the sunnah  composed of accounts called hadith  of Muhammad  c        June     CE   Muslims believe that Islam is the original  complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam  Noah  Abraham  Moses  and Jesus  As for the Quran  Muslims consider it to be the unaltered and final revelation of God  Religious concepts and practices include the five pillars of Islam  which are obligatory acts of worship  and following Islamic law  which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society  from banking and welfare to women and the environment  Certain religious rites and customs are observed by the Muslims in their family and social life  while social responsibilities to parents  relatives  and neighbors have also been defined  Besides  the Quran and the sunnah of Muhammad prescribe a comprehensive body of moral guidelines for Muslims to be followed in their personal  social  political  and religious life  Islam began in the early  th century  Originating in Mecca  it quickly spread in the Arabian Peninsula and by the  th century the Islamic empire was extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east  The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the  th century to the   th century when much of the historically Islamic world was experiencing a scientific  economic and cultural flourishing  The expansion of the Muslim world involved

to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe  the Mediterranean world  and the Near East  The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown  after the publication of his seminal work The World of Late Antiquity         Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate  but Brown proposes a period between the  rd and  th centuries AD  Generally  it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire s Crisis of the Third Century  c             to  in the East  the early Islamic period   th  th centuries   following the Muslim conquests in the mid  th century  In the West the end was earlier  with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the  th century  or earlier on the Western edges of the empire  The Roman Empire underwent considerable social  cultural and organizational changes starting with the reign of Diocletian  who began the custom of splitting the Empire into Eastern and Western halves ruled by multiple emperors  Beginning with Constantine the Great  Christianity was made legal in the Empire  and a new capital was founded at Constantinople  Migrations of Germanic tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late  th century onwards  culminating in the eventual collapse of the Empire in the West in      replaced by the so called barbarian kingdoms  The resultant cultural fusion of Greco Roman  Germanic and Christian traditions formed the foundations of the subsequent culture of Europe  The general decline of population  technological knowledge and standards of living in Europe during this period became the archetypal example of societal collapse for writers from the Renaissance until recent times  As a result of this decline  and the relative scarcity of historical records from Europe in particular  the period between the fall of the Empire and the Middle Ages became known as the  Dark Ages   a term displaced in most current periodisations by the introduction of  Late Antiquity    Latin alphabetThe classical Latin alphabet  also known as the Roman alphabet  is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language  The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet  which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad  which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics  The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet  which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet  During the Middle Ages the Latin alphabet was used  sometimes with modifications  for writing Romance languages  direct descendants of Latin  as well as Celtic  Germanic  Baltic  and some Slavic languages  With the age of colonialism and Christian evangelism  the Latin script spread beyond Europe  coming into use for writing indigenous American  Australian  Austronesian  Austroasiatic  and African languages  More recently  linguists have also tended to prefer the Latin script or the International Phonetic Alphabet  itself largely based on Latin script  when transcribing or creating written standards for non European languages  such as the African reference alphabet  The term Latin alphabet may refer to either the alphabet used to write Latin  as described in this article   or other alphabets based on the Latin script  which is the basic set of letters common to the various alphabets descended from the classical Latin alphabet  such as the English alphabet  These Latin alphabets may discard letters  like the Rotokas alphabet  or add new letters  like the Danish and Norwegian alphabets  Letter shapes have evolved over the centuries  including the development in Medieval Latin of lower case  forms which did not exist in the Classical period alphabet Latin alphabetsA Latin or Roman alphabet is one of many alphabets that use the letters of the Latin script  These letters formed the basis of the original Roman Latin alphabet  Some letters of the Latin script were altered slightly for use in particular languages  although the main letters are largely the same  There were several general types of alterations made to extend the alphabet s uses  depending on the language  diacritics could be added to existing letters  two letters could be fused together into ligatures  additional letters could be inserted  or pairs or triplets of letters could be treated as units  digraphs and trigraphs   Any additional letters were often given a place in the alphabet by defining an alphabetical order or collation sequence  which can vary between languages  Some of the additions  especially letters which only have diacritics added to them  were not considered distinct letters for this purpose  For example  the French   and the German    are not listed separately in their respective alphabet sequences  In some languages  digraphs are included in the collation sequence  e g  Hungarian CS  Welsh RH   The ISO basic Latin alphabet includes the    basic letters that are included in most alphabets  The International Phonetic Alphabet is also derived mainly from the Latin script  The tables below summarize and compare some of the alphabets  In this article  the scope of the word

central Italy  As Roman power spread Latin culture  Latins came to mean anyone who lives in a Latinized culture and speaks Latin or a Romance language  see Latin peoples   The original Latins were an Italic tribe inhabiting central Italy  in present day Lazio  Through the conquests of their most populous city state  Rome  the Latins culturally  Romanized  or  Latinized  the rest of Italy  and the word Latin ceased to mean a particular ethnicity  acquiring a more cultural sense  As the Roman Empire spread to include areas that are now Spain  Portugal  France  and Romania  these joined Italy in becoming  Latin   as the languages spoken in these countries derive primarily from the Latin Language  In the late   th   th centuries  a millennium after the fall of the Western Roman Empire  Portugal  Spain  and France began to create world empires  In consequence  by the mid   th century  the former American colonies of these nations became known as Latin America and this region s inhabitants as Latin Americans Letter  alphabet A letter is a grapheme  written character  in an alphabetic system of writing  such as the Greek alphabet and its descendants  Letters also appear in abjads and abugidas  variants of alphabets in which vowel marking is secondary or absent   Letters broadly denote phonemes in the spoken form of the language  although there is rarely a consistent exact correspondence between letters and phonemes  Written signs in other writing systems are best called syllabograms  which denote a syllable  or logograms  which denote a word or phrase  List of

case  or just case  is the distinction between the letters that are in larger upper case  also uppercase  capital letters  capitals  caps  large letters  or more formally majuscule  and smaller lower case  also lowercase  small letters  or more formally minuscule  in the written representation of certain languages  The writing systems that distinguish between the upper and lower case have two parallel sets of letters  with each letter in one set usually having an equivalent in the other set  Basically  the two case variants are alternative representations of the same letter  they have the same name and pronunciation and will be treated identically when sorting in alphabetical order  Letter case is generally applied in a mixed case fashion  with both upper  and lower case letters appearing in a given piece of text  The choice of case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline  In orthography  the upper case is primarily reserved for special purposes  such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun  which makes the lower case the more common variant in regular text  In mathematics  letter case may indicate the relationship between objects  with upper case letters often representing  superior  objects  e g  X could be a set containing the generic member x   In some contexts  it is conventional to use only one case  For example  engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper case letters  which are easier to distinguish than the lower case  especially when space restrictions

flow of information and access to Hitler  Bormann joined a paramilitary Freikorps organisation in      while working as manager of a large estate  He served nearly a year in prison as an accomplice to his friend Rudolf H ss  later commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp  in the murder of Walther Kadow  Bormann joined the Nazi Party in      and the Schutzstaffel  SS  in       He initially worked in the party s insurance service  and transferred in July      to the office of Deputy F hrer Rudolf Hess  where he served as chief of staff  Bormann used his position to create an extensive bureaucracy and involve himself as much as possible in the decision making  He gained acceptance into Hitler s inner circle  and accompanied him everywhere  providing briefings and summaries of events and requests  He began acting as Hitler s personal secretary in       a post to which he was officially appointed in       After Hess  solo flight to Britain on    May      to seek peace negotiations with the British government  Bormann assumed Hess  former duties  with the title of Head of the Parteikanzlei  Party Chancellery   He had final approval over civil service appointments  reviewed and approved legislation  and by      had de facto control over all domestic matters  Bormann was one of the leading proponents of the ongoing persecution of the Christian churches and favoured harsh treatment of Jews and Slavs in the areas conquered by Germany during World War II  Bormann returned with Hitler to the F hrerbunker in Berlin on    January      as the Red Army approached the city  After Hitler committed suicide  Bormann and others attempted to flee Berlin on   May to avoid capture by the Soviets  Bormann probably committed suicide on a bridge near Lehrter station  The body was buried nearby on   May       but was not found and confirmed as genuine until       Bormann was tried in absentia by the International Military Tribunal in the Nuremberg trials of      and       He was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging Morse codeMorse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on off tones  lights  or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment  It is named for Samuel F  B  Morse  an inventor of the telegraph  The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet  some extra Latin letters  the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals  prosigns  as standardized sequences of short and long signals called  dots  and  dashes   or  dits  and  dahs   as in amateur radio practice  Because many non English natural languages use more than the    Roman letters  extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages  Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character  letter or numeral  or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes  The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot  Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence  equal to the dot duration  The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots  one dash   and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots  The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission  To increase the speed of the communication  the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse varies approximately inversely to its frequency of occurrence in English  Thus the most common letter in English  the letter  E   has the shortest code  a single dot  Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators  although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing in most countries  Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding  Aeronautical navigational aids  such as VORs and NDBs  constantly identify in Morse code  Compared to voice  Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions  yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device  Morse is  therefore  a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels  Many amateur radio repeaters  for example  identify with Morse  even though they are used for voice communications   In an emergency  Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily  keyed  on and off  making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication  The most common distress signal is SOS or three dots  three dashes  and three dots

Middle Bronze Age  Middle Kingdom  script attested in a small corpus of inscriptions found at Serabit el Khadim in the Sinai Peninsula  Egypt  and the reconstructed common ancestor of the Phoenician and South Arabian scripts  and  by extension  of most historical and modern alphabets   It is also referred to as Sinaitic  Proto Canaanite  Old Canaanite  and Canaanite  The earliest  Proto Sinaitic  inscriptions are mostly dated to between the mid   th  early date  and the mid   th  late date  century BC   The principal debate is between an early date  around      BC  and a late date  around      BC  The choice of one or the other date decides whether it is proto Sinaitic or proto Canaanite  and by extension locates the invention of the alphabet in Egypt or Canaan respectively    The evolution of  Proto Sinaitic  and the various  Proto Canaanite  scripts during the Bronze Age is based on rather scant epigraphic evidence  it is only with the Bronze Age collapse and the rise of new Semitic kingdoms in the Levant that the direct ancestor of the Iron Age Phoenician alphabet  also known as  Proto Canaanite   is clearly attested  Byblos inscriptions   The so called  Proto Sinaitic inscriptions  were discovered in the winter of           in Sinai by Hilda and Flinders Petrie  To this may be added a number of short  Proto Canaanite  inscriptions found in Canaan and dated to between the   th and   th centuries  and more recently  the discovery in      of the so called  Wadi el Hol inscriptions   found in Middle Egypt by John and Deborah Darnell  The Wadi el Hol inscriptions strongly suggest a date of development of Proto Sinaitic writing from the mid   th to   th centuries BC NounA noun  from Latin n men  literally meaning  name   is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things  such as living creatures  objects  places  actions  qualities  states of existence  or ideas  Linguistically  a noun is a member of a large  open part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a clause  the object of a verb  or the object of a preposition  Lexical categories  parts of speech  are defined in terms of the ways in which their members combine with other kinds of expressions  The syntactic rules for nouns differ from language to language  In English  nouns are those words which can occur with articles and attributive adjectives and can function as the head of a noun phrase Numeric character referenceA numeric character reference  NCR  is a common markup construct used in SGML and SGML derived markup languages such as HTML and XML  It consists of a short sequence of characters that  in turn  represents a single character  Since WebSgml  XML and HTML    the code points of the Universal Character Set  UCS  of Unicode are used  NCRs are typically used in order to represent characters that are not directly encodable in a particular document  for example  because they are international characters that don t fit in the   bit character set being used  or because they have special syntactic meaning in the language   When the document is interpreted by a markup aware reader  each NCR is treated as

Contemporary Latin  it is called prisca Latinitas   ancient Latin   rather than vetus Latina   old Latin    as vetus Latina is used to refer to a set of Biblical texts  The use of  old    early  and

forms not generally found in works written under the Roman Empire  This article presents some of the major differences  The earliest known specimen of the Latin language is from the Praeneste fibula  A new analysis performed in      declared it to be genuine  beyond any reasonable doubt  and dating from the Orientalizing period  in the first half of the seventh century BC Oxford English DictionaryThe Oxford English Dictionary  OED  is a descriptive dictionary of the English language  published by the Oxford University Press  It traces the historical development of the English language  providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers  as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world  The second edition came to        pages in    volumes  published in       Work began on the dictionary in       but it was not until      that it began to be published in unbound fascicles as work continued on the project  under the name of A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles  Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society  In       the title The Oxford English Dictionary  OED  was first used unofficially on the covers of the series  and in      the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes  In       the title The Oxford English Dictionary fully replaced the former name in all

of writing  not the textual content of documents   Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering  reading  and dating historical manuscripts  and the cultural context of writing  including the methods with which writing and books were produced  and the history of scriptoria  The discipline is important for understanding  authenticating  and dating ancient texts  However  it cannot in general be used to pinpoint dates with high precision Peninsular SpanishPeninsular Spanish  also known as European Spanish and Iberian Spanish  refers to the varieties of the Spanish language spoken in the Iberian Peninsula  as opposed to the Spanish spoken in the Americas and in the Canary Islands  The related term Castilian Spanish is often applied to formal varieties of Spanish as spoken in Spain  In phonology  the most prominent distinguishing element of Peninsular Spanish varieties  except for the southernmost ones  is the preservation of a distinction between the phonemes  s  and      represented respectively with the letters  s  on one hand and  z   or  c  before  e   i   on the other  This is usually called distinci n in Spanish  while the merger of both phonemes is called seseo  While in the Spanish of the Americas and in parts of southern Spain  z    c  before  e   i   and  s   are typically read roughly like the English  s   in the Peninsular dialects with distinci n   z   and  c  before  e   i   are read aloud as      that is  the initial sound of the English word think  However  many Andalusian dialects and the Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands do not use distinci n as a general rule  but rather use either seseo or ceceo  In morphology  the most notable distinguishing feature of Peninsular Spanish is the use of the pronoun vosotros  along with its oblique form os  and its corresponding verb forms for the second person plural familiar  In virtually all other varieties of Modern Spanish  for the second person plural  the familiar and the formal are merged in ustedes  with its verb forms  Again  the use of vosotros is uncommon in the Canary Islands and only partially introduced in Western Andalusia Phoenician alphabetThe Phoenician alphabet  called by convention the Proto Canaanite alphabet for inscriptions older than around      BC  is the oldest verified alphabet  The Phoenician alphabet is an abjad consisting of    letters  all consonants  with matres lectionis used for some vowels in certain late varieties  It was used for the writing of Phoenician  a Northern Semitic language  used by the civilization of Phoenicia  Some think that the Phoenician alphabet is derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs  It became one of the most widely used writing systems  spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world  where it evolved and was assimilated by many other cultures  The Paleo Hebrew alphabet was directly derived from Phoenician  Another derivative script is the Aramaic alphabet  which was the ancestor of the modern Arabic script  The Modern Hebrew script is a stylistic variant of the Aramaic script  The Greek alphabet  and by extension its descendants  such as Latin  Cyrillic  Runic  and Coptic  was also derived from Phoenician  As the letters were originally incised with a stylus  most of the shapes are angular and straight  although more cursive versions are increasingly attested in later times  culminating in the Neo Punic alphabet of Roman era North Africa  Phoenician was usually written from right to left  although there are some texts written in boustrophedon Phonological history of English consonant clustersThe phonological history of the English language includes various changes in the phonology of consonant clusters PluralThe plural  sometimes abbreviated PL   in many languages  is one of the values of the grammatical category of number  Plural of nouns typically denote a quantity other than the default quantity represented by a noun  which is generally one  the form that represents this default quantity is said to be of singular number   Most commonly  therefore  plurals are used to denote two or more of something  although they may also denote more than fractional  zero or negative amounts  An example of a plural is the English word cats  which corresponds to the singular cat  Words of other types  such as verbs  adjectives and pronouns  also frequently have distinct plural forms  which are used in agreement with the number of their associated nouns  Some languages also have a dual  denoting exactly two of something  or other systems of number categories  However  in English and many other languages  singular and plural are the only grammatical numbers  except for possible remnants of the dual in pronouns such as both and either Portuguese dialectsPortuguese dialects are mutually intelligible variations of the Portuguese language over Portuguese speaking countries and other areas holding some degree of cultural bound with the language  Portuguese has two standard forms of writing and numerous regional spoken variations  with often large phonological and lexical differences   The standard written form of Portuguese used in Brazil is regulated by the Brazilian Academy of Letters and is sometimes called Brazilian Portuguese  although the term primarily means all dialects spoken in Brazil as a whole   In Portugal  the language is regulated by the Sciences Academy of Lisbon  Class of Letters  which shapes the standard spelling set of norms associated with European Portuguese  This written variation is the one preferred by Portuguese African and Asian ex colonies  including Cabo Verde  Mozambique  Angola  Timor Leste  Macau and Goa  Differences between Brazilian and European written forms of Portuguese occur in a similar way  and are often compared to  those of American and British English  though spelling divergencies are generally believed to occur with a little greater frequency in the two Portuguese written dialects  Differences in syntax and word construction  not directly related with spelling  are also observed  Furthermore  there were attempts to unify the two written variations  the most recent of them being the Orthographic Agreement of       which only began to take effect in the     s and is still under implementation in some countries  This and previous reforms faced criticism by people who say they are unnecessary or inefficient or even that they create more differences instead of reducing or eliminating them  The differences between the various spoken Portuguese dialects are mostly in phonology  in the frequency of usage of certain grammatical forms  and especially in the distance between the formal and informal levels of speech  Lexical differences are numerous but largely confined to  peripheral  words  such as plants  animals  and other local items  with little impact in the core lexicon  Dialectal deviations from the official grammar are relatively few  As a consequence  all Portuguese dialects are mutually intelligible although for some of the most extremely divergent pairs  the phonological changes may make it difficult for speakers to understand rapid speech Portuguese languagePortuguese  portugu s or  in full  l ngua portuguesa  is a Romance language and the sole official language of Portugal  Brazil  Cape Verde  Guinea Bissau  Mozambique  Angola  and S o Tom  and Pr ncipe  It also has co official language status in East Timor  Equatorial Guinea and Macau  As the result of expansion during colonial times  a cultural presence of Portuguese and Portuguese creole speakers are also found in Goa  Daman and Diu in India  in Batticaloa on the east coast of Sri Lanka  in the Indonesian island of Flores  in Malacca of Malaysia  and the ABC islands in the Caribbean where Papiamento is spoken  while Cape Verdean Creole is the most widely spoken Porteguese based Creole  Portuguese is part of the Ibero Romance group that evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in the medieval Kingdom of Galicia  and has kept some Celtic phonology  With approximately     to     million native speakers and     million total speakers  Portuguese is usually listed as the sixth most natively spoken language in the world  the third most spoken European language in the world in terms of native speakers  and a major language of the Southern Hemisphere  It is also the most spoken language in South America and the second most spoken in Latin America after Spanish  and is an official language of the European Union  Mercosul  OAS  ECOWAS and the African Union  Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes once called Portuguese  the sweet and gracious language  and Spanish playwright Lope de Vega referred to it as  sweet   while the Brazilian writer Olavo Bilac poetically described it as a  ltima flor do L cio  inculta e bela  the last flower of Latium  rustic and beautiful   Portuguese is also termed  the language of Cam es   after Lu s Vaz de Cam es  one of the greatest literary figures in the Portuguese language and author of the Portuguese epic poem  Os Lus adas  In March       the Museum of the Portuguese Language  an interactive museum about the Portuguese language  was founded in S o Paulo  Brazil  the city with the greatest number of Portuguese language speakers in the world  The museum is the first of its kind in the world  In      the museum was destroyed in a fire  but there are plans to reconstruct it Praeneste fibulaThe Praeneste fibula  the  brooch of Palestrina   is a golden fibula or brooch  today housed in the Museo Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini in Rome  The fibula bears an inscription in Old Latin  At the time of its discovery in the late nineteenth century  it was accepted as the earliest known specimen of the Latin language  The authenticity of the inscription has since been disputed  A new analysis performed in      declared it to be genuine  beyond any reasonable doubt  and to date from the Orientalizing period  in the first half of the seventh century BC Present tenseThe present tense  abbreviated PRES or PRS  is a grammatical tense whose principal function is to locate a situation or event in present time  The term present tense is usually used in descriptions of specific languages to refer to a particular grammatical form or set of forms  these may have a variety of uses  not all of which will necessarily refer to present time  For example  in the English sentence  My train leaves tomorrow morning   the verb form leaves is said to be in the present tense  even though in this particular context it refers to an event in future time  Similarly  in the historical present  the present tense is used to narrate events that occurred in the past  There are two common types of present tense form in most Indo European languages  the present indicative  the combination of present tense and indicative mood  and the present subjunctive  the combination of present tense and subjunctive mood  ProparoxytoneProparoxytone  Greek                  proparox tonos  is a linguistic term for a word with stress on the antepenultimate  third last  syllable such as the English words  cinema  and  operational   Related terms are paroxytone  stress on the last but one  and oxytone  accented on the last one   In English  most nouns of three or more syllables are proparoxytones  except in words ending in  tion or  sion that tend to be paroxytones  operation  equivocation  television   This tendency is so strong in English that it frequently leads to the stress moving to a different part of the root in order to preserve an antepenultimate stress  For example  the root photograph gives rise to the nouns photography and photographer  family   familiar  In medieval Latin lyric poetry  a proparoxytonic line or half line is one where the antepenultimate syllable is stressed  as in the first half of the verse  Estuans intrinsecus    ira vehementi  PunctuationPunctuation is the use of spacing  conventional signs  and certain typographical devices as aids to the understanding and the correct reading  both silently and aloud  of handwritten and printed texts  Another description is   The practice  action  or system of inserting points or other small marks into texts  in order to aid interpretation  division of text into sentences  clauses  etc   by means of such marks   In written English  punctuation is vital to disambiguate the meaning of sentences  For example   woman  without her man  is nothing   emphasizing the importance of men   and  woman  without her  man is nothing   emphasizing the importance of women  have very different meanings  as do  eats shoots and leaves   which means the subject consumes plant growths  and  eats  shoots  and leaves   which means the subject eats first  then fires a weapon  and then leaves the scene   The sharp differences in meaning are produced by the simple differences in punctuation within the example pairs  especially the latter  The rules of punctuation vary with language  location  register and time and are constantly evolving  Certain aspects of punctuation are stylistic and are thus the author s  or editor s  choice  or tachygraphic language forms  such as those used in online chat and text messages QQ  named cue   kju    is the   th letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet  In nearly all languages using the Latin alphabet it is a consonant  not a vowel RR  named ar or    r   is the   th letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet Roman cursiveRoman cursive  or Latin cursive  is a form of handwriting  or a script  used in ancient Rome and to some extent into the Middle Ages  It is customarily divided into old  or ancient  cursive  and new cursive Roman numeralsThe numeric system represented by Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages  Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet  Roman numerals  as used today  are based on seven symbols   The use of Roman numerals continued long after the decline of the Roman Empire  From the   th century on  Roman numerals began to be replaced in most contexts by the more convenient Hindu Arabic numerals  however  this process was gradual  and the use of Roman numerals persists in some minor applications to this day Romance languagesThe Romance languages  sometimes called the Romanic languages  Latin languages  or Neo Latin languages  are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin between the sixth and ninth centuries and that thus form a branch of the Italic languages within the Indo European language family  Today  around     million people are native speakers worldwide  mainly in Europe and the Americas  but also elsewhere  Additionally  the major Romance languages have many non native speakers and are in widespread use as lingua francas  This is especially the case for French  which is in widespread use throughout Central and West Africa  Madagascar  Mauritius and the Maghreb  The five most widely spoken Romance languages by number of native speakers are Spanish      million   Portuguese      million   French     million   Italian     million   and Romanian     million   Because of the difficulty of imposing boundaries on a continuum  various counts of the modern Romance languages are given  for example  Dalby lists    based on mutual intelligibility  The following  more extensive

variants are also known as futhark or fu ark  derived from their first six letters of the alphabet  F  U     A  R  and K   the Anglo Saxon variant is futhorc or fu orc  due to sound changes undergone in Old English by the names of those six letters   Runology is the study of the runic alphabets  runic inscriptions  runestones  and their history  Runology forms a specialised branch of Germanic linguistics  The earliest runic inscriptions date from around     AD  The characters were generally replaced by the Latin alphabet as the cultures that had used runes underwent Christianisation  by approximately     AD in central Europe and      AD in northern Europe  However  the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes in northern Europe  Until the early   th century  runes were used in rural Sweden for decorative purposes in Dalarna and on Runic calendars  The three best known runic alphabets are the Elder Futhark  around         AD   the Anglo Saxon Futhorc           AD   and the Younger Futhark           AD   The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long branch runes  also called Danish  although they were also used in Norway and Sweden   short branch or R k runes  also called Swedish Norwegian  although they were also used in Denmark   and the stavl sa or H lsinge runes  staveless runes   The Younger Futhark developed further into the Medieval runes            AD   and the Dalecarlian runes  around           AD   Historically  the runic alphabet is a derivation of the Old Italic scripts of antiquity  with the addition of some innovations  Which variant of the Old Italic family in particular gave rise to the runes is uncertain  Suggestions include Raetic  Venetic  Etruscan  or Old Latin as candidates  At the time  all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for epigraphy  which would become characteristic of the runes  The process of transmission of the script is unknown  The oldest inscriptions are found in Denmark and northern Germany  not near Italy  A  West Germanic hypothesis  suggests transmission via Elbe Germanic groups  while a  Gothic hypothesis  presumes transmission via East Germanic expansion S commaS

languages to represent the sound  s    In       it was adopted into the orthography of Shona for a  whistled  s  but it was dropped in      due to the lack of the character on typewriters and fonts

The Arabic alphabet  however  uses a letter based on Phoenician   n to represent  s   see there   however  that glyph takes Samekh s place in the traditional Abjadi order of the Arabic alphabet  The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Xi        San  letter San     was an archaic letter of the Greek alphabet  Its shape was similar to modern M  or to a modern Greek Sigma     turned sideways  and it was used as an alternative to Sigma to denote the sound  s   Unlike Sigma  whose position in the alphabet is between Rho and Tau  San appeared between Pi and Qoppa in alphabetic order  In addition to denoting this separate archaic character  the name  San  was also used as an alternative name to denote the standard letter Sigma List of Latin script trigraphsA number of trigraphs are found in the Latin script  most of these used especially in Irish orthography SchwabacherThe German word Schwabacher  pronounced    va  bax    refers to a specific blackletter typeface which evolved

de BacchanalibusThe senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus   senatorial decree concerning the Bacchanalia   is a notable Old Latin inscription dating to     BC  It was discovered in      at Tiriolo  southern Italy  Published by the presiding praetor  it conveys the substance of a decree of the Roman Senate prohibiting the Bacchanalia throughout all Italy  except in certain special cases which must be approved specifically by the Senate  When members of the elite began to participate  information was put before the Senate by Publius Aebutius and his lover and neighbour Hispala Faecenia  who was also a well known prostitute  as told in the Ab Urbe Condita Libri of Livy  The cult was held to be a threat to the security of the state  investigators were appointed  rewards were offered to informants  legal processes were put in place and the Senate began the official suppression of the cult throughout Italy  According to the Augustan historian Livy  the chief historical source  many committed suicide to avoid indictment  The stated penalty for leadership was death  Livy stated that there were more executions than imprisonments  After the conspiracy had been quelled the Bacchanalia survived in southern Italy  The Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus can be seen as a piece of realpolitik  a display of the Roman senate s authority to its Italian allies after the Second Punic War  and a reminder to any Roman politician  populist and would be generalissimo that the Senate s collective authority trumped all personal ambition  Nevertheless  the extent and ferocity of the official response to the Bacchanalia was probably unprecedented  and betrays some form of moral panic on the part of Roman authorities  Burkert finds  nothing comparable in religious history

instead marked with the same symbol used for registered trademarks  the registered trademark symbol    The proper manner to display the symbol is immediately following the mark in superscript style  The character is mapped in Unicode as U        Service mark  HTML           Unlike the similar trademark symbol  there is no simple way to type the service mark symbol on Microsoft Windows  but the built in charmap application can help  In Microsoft Outlook or Word type      and Alt X  On Macintosh systems  the symbol can be inserted by using the Character Palette  On Linux systems  it can be inserted by pressing Compose  then s and finally m Sh  digraph Sh is a digraph of the Latin alphabet  a combination of S and H   Shin  letter Shin  also spelled  in    n  or Sheen  is the name of the twenty first letter of the Semitic abjads  including Phoenician Shin   Hebrew Shin     Aramaic Shin   Syriac Shin    and Arabic Shin     in abjadi order    th in modern order   Its sound value is a voiceless sibilant      or  s   The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Sigma      which in turn gave Latin S and Cyrillic     and the letter Sha in the Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts        The South Arabian and Ethiopian letter  awt is also cognate Sho  letter The letter    sometimes called  sho  or  san   was a letter added to the Greek alphabet in order to write the Bactrian language  It was similar in appearance to the Anglo Saxon and Icelandic letter thorn      which has typically been used to represent it in modern print  although both are historically quite unrelated  It probably represented a sound similar to English  sh         Its conventional transliteration in Latin is       Its original name and position in the Bactrian alphabet  if it had any  are unknown  Some authors have called it  san   on the basis of the hypothesis that it was a survival or reintroduction of the archaic Greek letter San  It closely resembles  perhaps coincidentally  a letter of the Greek based Carian alphabet which may have also stood for      The name  sho  was coined for the letter for purposes of modern computer encoding in       on the basis of analogy with  rho       the letter with

Swedish  sj ljudet  is a voiceless fricative phoneme found in most dialects  It has a variety of realisations  whose precise phonetic characterisation is a matter of debate  but which usually feature distinct labialization  The sound is represented in Swedish orthography by a number of spellings  including the digraph  sj  from which the common Swedish name is derived as well as  stj    skj   and  sk  before front vowels  The sound should not be confused with the Swedish tj sound      often spelled tj or k in Swedish  The sound is transcribed     in the International Phonetic Alphabet  The International Phonetic Association  IPA  describes     as a  simultaneous     and  x    but this claim is disputed among phoneticians  including at least one former president of the IPA  Other descriptive labels include voiceless postalveolo velar fricative  voiceless palatal velar fricative  voiceless dorso palatal velar fricative  voiceless postalveolar and velar fricative  or voiceless coarticulated velar and palatoalveolar fricative  The closest English phoneme is      sh   however  the phone      wh  present in some English dialects is a close approximation as well Sowil  Sowil

hundreds of millions of native speakers across the world  after Mandarin Chinese  it is usually considered the world s second most spoken native language  Spanish is a part of the Ibero Romance group of languages  which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the  th century  The oldest Latin texts which show traces of Spanish come from mid northern Iberia in the  th century  and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo  then capital of the Kingdom of Castile  in the   th century  Beginning in the early   th century  Spanish was taken to the colonies of the Spanish Empire  most notably to the Americas  as well as territories in Africa  Oceania and the Philippines  Around     of modern Spanish is derived from Latin  Greek has also contributed substantially to Spanish vocabulary  especially through Latin  on which it had a great impact  Spanish vocabulary has been in contact from an early date with Arabic  having developed during the Al Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula  With around    of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin  this language is the second most important influence after Latin  It has also been influenced by Basque as well as by neighboring Ibero Romance languages  It also adopted words from non Iberian languages such as Gothic language from the Visigoths in which many Spanish names and surnames have a Visigothic origin  It has absorbed vocabulary from other languages  particularly the Romance languages Occitan  French  Italian and Sardinian  as well as from Nahuatl  Quechua  and other indigenous languages of the Americas  Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations  It is also used as an official language by the European Union  the Organization of American States  the Union of South American Nations  the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and by many other international organizations  It is the second language in the world by the number of people who speak it as a mother tongue  after Mandarin Chinese  with     million native speakers SpesmiloThe spesmilo  pronounced  spes milo   plural spesmiloj  spes

addition of a sequence of numbers  the result is their sum or total  If numbers are added sequentially from left to right  any intermediate result is a partial sum  prefix sum  or running total of the summation  The numbers to be summed  called addends  or sometimes summands  may be integers  rational numbers  real numbers  or complex numbers  Besides numbers  other types of values can be added as well  vectors  matrices  polynomials and  in general  elements of any additive group  or even monoid   For finite sequences of such elements  summation always produces a well defined sum  The summation of an infinite sequence of values is called a series  A value of such a series may often be defined by means of a limit  although sometimes the value may be infinite  and often no value results at all   Another notion involving limits of finite sums is integration  The summation of the sequence              is an expression whose value is the sum of each of the members of the sequence  In the example                     Because addition is associative  the sum does not depend on how the additions are grouped  for instance                   and                   both have the value    therefore  parentheses are usually omitted in repeated additions  Addition is also commutative  so permuting the terms of a finite sequence does not change its sum  for infinite summations this property may fail  see Absolute convergence for conditions under which it still holds   There is no special notation for the summation of such explicit sequences  as the corresponding repeated addition expression will do  There is only a slight difficulty if the sequence has fewer than two elements  the summation of a sequence of one term involves no plus sign  it is indistinguishable from the term itself  and the summation of the empty sequence cannot even be written down  but one can write its value     in its place   If  however  the terms of the sequence are given by a regular pattern  possibly of variable length  then a summation operator may be useful or even essential  For the summation of the sequence of consecutive integers from   to      one could use an addition expression involving an ellipsis to indicate the missing terms                                  In this case  the reader can easily guess the pattern  However  for more complicated patterns  one needs to be precise about the rule used to find successive terms  which can be achieved by using the summation operator      Using this sigma notation the above summation is written as                                                              i

 for instance by mathematical induction  that                                                             i

summations of terms following a regular pattern  The term  indefinite summation  refers to the search for an inverse image of a given infinite sequence s of values for the forward difference operator  in other words for a sequence  called antidifference of s  whose finite differences are given by s  By contrast  summation as discussed in this article is called  definite summation   When it is necessary to clarify that numbers are added with their signs  the term algebraic sum is used  For example  in electric circuit theory Kirchhoff s circuit laws consider the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point  assigning opposite signs to currents flowing in and out of the node S tterlinS tterlinschrift  German pronunciation    z t li n    ft    S tterlin script

independently and have only had common ownership since       In      the historian of journalism Allan Nevins analysed the importance of The Times in shaping the views of events of London s elite   For much more than a century The Times has been an integral and important part of the political structure of Great Britain  Its news and its editorial comment have in general been carefully coordinated  and have at most times been handled with an earnest sense of responsibility  While the paper has admitted some trivia to its columns  its whole emphasis has been on important public affairs treated with an eye to the best interests of Britain  To guide this treatment  the editors have for long periods been in close touch with    Downing Street   The Times is the first newspaper to have borne that name  lending it to numerous other papers around the world  including The Times of India  founded in        The Straits Times  Singapore          The New York Times         The

single glyph  An example is the character   as used in English  in which the letters a and e are joined  The common ampersand     developed from a ligature in which the handwritten Latin letters e and t  spelling et  from the Latin for  and   were combined UU  named u   ju    plural ues  is the   st letter and the fifth vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet UTF  UTF   is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters  or code points  defined by Unicode and originally designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike  The encoding is variable length and uses   bit code units  It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII and to avoid the complications of endianness and byte order marks in the alternative UTF    and UTF    encodings  The name is derived from Unicode  or Universal Coded Character Set  Transformation Format      bit   UTF   is the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web  accounting for       of all Web pages in March       the most popular East Asian encodings  Shift JIS and GB       have      and      respectively   The Internet Mail Consortium  IMC  recommended that all e mail programs be able to display and create mail using UTF    and the W C recommends UTF   as the default encoding in XML and HTML  UTF   encodes each of the           valid code points in Unicode using one to four   bit bytes  Code points with lower numerical values  which tend to occur more frequently  are encoded using fewer bytes  The first     characters of Unicode  which correspond one to one with ASCII  are encoded using a single octet with the same binary value as ASCII  so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF   encoded Unicode as well  Since ASCII bytes do not occur when encoding non ASCII code points into UTF    UTF   is safe to use within most programming and document languages that interpret certain ASCII characters in a special way  such as     in filenames and     in printf UnicodeUnicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding  representation  and handling of text expressed in most of the world s writing systems  Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set  UCS  standard and published as The Unicode Standard  the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than         characters covering     modern and historic scripts  as well as multiple symbol sets  The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference  an encoding method and set of standard character encodings  a set of reference data files  and a number of related items  such as character properties  rules for normalization  decomposition  collation  rendering  and bidirectional display order  for the correct display of text containing both right to left scripts  such as Arabic and Hebrew  and left to right scripts   As of June       the most recent version is Unicode      The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium  Unicode s success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread and predominant use in the internationalization and localization of computer software  The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies  including modern operating systems  XML  Java  and other programming languages   and the  NET Framework  Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings  The most commonly used encodings are UTF    UTF    and the now obsolete UCS    UTF   uses one byte for any ASCII character  all of which have the same code values in both UTF   and ASCII encoding  and up to four bytes for other characters  UCS   uses a    bit code unit  two   bit bytes  for each character but cannot encode every character in the current Unicode standard  UTF    extends UCS    using one    bit unit for the characters that were representable in UCS   and two    bit units        bits  to handle each of the additional characters VV  named vee   vi     is the   nd letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet VerbA verb  from the Latin verbum meaning word  is a word  part of speech  that in syntax conveys an action  bring  read  walk  run  learn   an occurrence  happen  become   or a state of being  be  exist  stand   In the usual description of English  the basic form  with or without the particle to  is the infinitive  In many languages  verbs are inflected  modified in form  to encode tense  aspect  mood  and voice  A verb may also agree with the person  gender or number of some of its arguments  such as its subject  or object  Verbs have tenses  present  to indicate that an action is being carried out  past  to indicate that an action has been done  future  to indicate that an action will be done Visigothic scriptVisigothic script was a type of medieval script that originated in the Visigothic kingdom in Hispania  the Iberian Peninsula  modern Spain and Portugal   Its more limiting alternative designations littera toletana and littera mozarabica associate it with scriptoria specifically in Toledo and with Mozarabic culture more generally  respectively  The script  which exists in book hand and cursive versions  was used from approximately the late seventh century until the thirteenth century  mostly in Visigothic Iberia but also somewhat in southern France  It was perfected in the  th   th centuries and declined afterwards  It developed from uncial script  and shares many features of uncial  especially an uncial form of the letter  g    Other features of the script include an open top a  very similar to the letter  u    similar shapes for the letters  r  and  s   and a long letter  i  resembling the modern letter  l   There are two forms of the letter  d   one with a straight vertical ascender  and another with an ascender slanting towards the left  The top stroke of the letter  t   by itself  has a hook curving to the left   t  also has a number of other forms when used in ligatures and there are two different ligatures for the two sounds of  ti    hard  or unassibilated and  soft or sibilated  as spoken in Hispano Latin during this period  The letters  e  and  r  also have many different forms when written in ligature  Of particular interest is the special Visigothic z      which after adoption into Carolingian handwriting eventually transformed into the c cedilla      From the standard script  a capital letter display script was developed  with long slender forms  There was also a cursive form used for charters and non religious writings  which had northern   Leonese   and southern   Mozarabic   forms  The Leonese cursive was used in the Christian north  while the Mozarabic was used by Christians living in the Muslim south  The cursive forms were probably influenced by Roman cursive  brought to Iberia from North Africa  Visigothic script has many similarities with Beneventan script and Merovingian script Voiced alveolar fricativeThe voiced alveolar fricatives are consonantal sounds  The symbol in the International Phonetic

employed in ancient Greece during the archaic and early classical periods  until they were replaced by the classical    letter alphabet that is the standard today  around     BC  All forms of the Greek alphabet were originally based on the shared inventory of the    symbols of the Phoenician alphabet  with the exception of the letter Samekh  whose Greek counterpart Xi     was used only in a sub group of Greek alphabets  and with the common addition of Upsilon     for the vowel  u      The local  so called epichoric  alphabets differed in many ways  in the use of the consonant symbols      and    in the use of the innovative long vowel letters    and     in the absence or presence of   in its original consonant function   h    in the use or non use of certain archaic letters       w

a reduced form of the Elder Futhark  consisting of only    characters  in use from about the  th century  after a  transitional period  which lasted during the  th and  th centuries  The reduction  somewhat paradoxically  happened at the same time as phonetic changes led to a greater number of different phonemes in the spoken language  when Proto Norse evolved into Old Norse  Thus  the language included distinct sounds and minimal pairs which were not separate in writing  The Younger Futhark is divided into long branch  Danish  and short twig  Swedish and Norwegian  runes  in the   th century further expanded by the  H lsinge Runes  or staveless runes  The lifetime of the Younger Futhark corresponds roughly to the Viking Age  Their use declined after the Christianization of Scandinavia  most writing in Scandinavia from the   th century was in the Latin alphabet  but the runic scripts survived in marginal use  in the form of the Medieval runes  in use ca             and

eszett is  in origin  a ligature of two minuscule  lowercase  letters  long s and tailed z  and as such has no traditional majuscule form  Nevertheless  typefaces used for printing German language texts during the early   th century have often included capital eszett glyphs  There have also been repeated calls to include capital eszett into official German orthography  particularly in the early   th century  and again during the     s and     s in East Germany  but the character has never entered widespread use  and has never been part of official orthography  Capital       was introduced as

formerly used in the International Phonetic Alphabet to represent palatalized consonants  It is a small  leftwards facing hook joined to the bottom right side of a letter  and is distinguished from various other hooks indicating retroflexion  etc  The IPA recommended that esh       and ezh     not use the palatal hook  but instead get special curled symbols    and    However  versions with the hook may have been used by some authors  The palatal hook was withdrawn by the IPA in       in favour of a superscript j following the consonant  i e     becomes t    Palatal hooks are also used in Lithuanian dialectology by the Lithuanian Phonetic Transcription System  or Lithuanian Phonetic Alphabet      lowercase     is a letter of the Latin alphabet  formed by S with the addition of a dot

grapheme  It may be used as a diacritic to derive new letters from old ones  or simply as an addition to make a grapheme more distinct from others  It can take the form of a vertical bar  slash  or crossbar  A stroke is sometimes drawn through the numbers   and    to make them more distinguishable  In phonetic transcription  a stroke through a letter often indicates that the sound is a fricative
